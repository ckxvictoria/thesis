The role of the Board and Trustees of the Archibald Corbett Community Library, Arts and Heritage Centre

In June 2016 the Archibald Corbett Society and the Corbett Residents’ Association joined forces to form a company limited by guarantee and a charity with the intention of saving the Torridon Road Library from being closed down by the Council and which re-opened as a community library and arts and heritage centre at the end of October 2016.

The company limited by guarantee acts as the legal structure to run the Charity. The Company has a Board of directors and the Charity has Trustees. It is the responsibility of both the board and the Trustees to ensure the organisation is run in accordance with the Articles of Association which govern how the Centre is operated in accordance with its objects.

Board members/Trustees are also responsible for overseeing the financial affairs of the ACCLAHC to include publishing a report and accounts each year which is filed at Companies House and the Charities Commission. The Board meets bi monthly where it discusses finances, how the Library is operating on a day to day basis and the future development of the Centre to ensure its long term sustainability.

There are currently ten Board members who are also the Trustees of the Charity and a Secretary. Our board members all live, or have lived, on the Corbett Estate and have a range of experience in building management, accountancy, education, child welfare, community business management, media, fundraising, IT and health.

We are always looking for new members from our local community who feel they could contribute skills and ideas that will help maintain and develop the Centre as a vibrant asset for the benefit of local residents.

If you are interested, please contact our Chair, Pat Merry.

There was already a railway running through the Hither Green area, built in the mid-1860s, but no station, so there hadn’t been much development. It was still mostly open fields and a few large houses built by those rich enough to be able to escape the pressures of London living. That all changed in 1895, when the South Eastern Railway finally decided to build a station, and call time forever on the rural way of life. Within a year Archibald had started an enormous building project, which would eventually stretch for a mile south of the station, and half a mile in width below Brownhill Road, the main east-west thoroughfare in the area. He would build over 3,000 houses in this, the largest of his seven developments by population.

What we in Catford and Hither Green call “The Corbett Estate” actually began life with a rather different name: ‘St Germans’. I don’t think anyone knows when the official name was lost – it was probably a slow process over a period of years as the area around the estate became more built up and it slowly lost its distinctive identity. ‘St Germans’ was chosen to commemorate the landowner from whom Archibald bought the farmland for his houses – a whopping 278 acres. Henry Eliot was the 5th Earl of St Germans, and took his title from the parish where he lived in Cornwall. The parish in turn was named after the French bishop of Auxerre, Germanus, who came to Britain shortly after the Romans left around 410AD, and was canonized for various worthy deeds. There can’t be many south London housing estates named after a 5th century French saint!

Once he’d bought the land, Corbett set about doing some deals with the railway company to make his future estate more attractive to commuters. In March 1896 he loaned South Eastern Railway (SER) £3,400 to build a second entrance to the station on Springbank Road, which would be more convenient for the estate. He also negotiated ten years of reduced season tickets (£2 off first class and £1 10s off second class, while third class tickets could ‘be purchased by residents on the estate at the cheap Catford Bridge rates’) 11. It was actually fifteen years later that the deals ended, when the Secretary of SER informed the board that “the concession is the only one of its kind on the company’s system, and the agreement … has caused considerable dissatisfaction amongst season ticket holders who did not happen to live on that particular estate” 12.

Corbett must have been very pleased to come across James Watt, a Catford builder who was a fellow Scot, and who went on to build around a third of the estate. Another large scale contractor was Frederick Taylor, who lived on the estate in Wellmeadow Road. There is evidence that quite a few chunks of the estate’s land were sold on to other companies for development, but it’s also clear that Corbett exercised strict control over what they were allowed to build, which meant it was kept carefully in step with his overall plan. House dimensions, costs and materials were specified and plans had to be approved by Corbett’s managers.

By 1899 building work was proceeding apace, and the estate came to the notice of one of Charles Booth’s researchers. Booth was a social reformer who was mapping London’s housing in terms of how well off the occupiers were, in order to gain a more accurate picture of poverty in the city. The researcher, Ernest Aves, teamed up with a local policeman, PC Lloyds, and walked with him on his rapidly expanding Lewisham beat. In November 1899 he described the development: “Duncrievie Road brings us to the beginning of the St Germans Estate, which is being rapidly laid out according to the general plans of a large speculative builder – Mr Corbett. There is much sub-letting of the work and several builders are said to be at work on the estate, but the man just mentioned is the contractor and speculator in chief. It is said that when all has been built over, there will be something like 3,000 houses … The heads of the households go mainly citywards to work. No licensed house is allowed on the estate and it is, I believe, Mr Corbett who has enforced this provision … There are two shopping centres, one in Springbank Road, which has a kind of Parade, called ‘The Market’, at the north end, and a similar centre is being made in part of Brownhill Road with the name of The Pavement. The latter is rather for the future, but neither are yet very flourishing”.14

Aves and PC Lloyds wandered up across Brownhill Road, which he described as “the swell road of the Estate, red as far as covered” (red denoted the second-highest of seven categories of occupant – what Booth called ‘middle class well-to-do’) to Sandhurst Road near the corner with Ardgowan Road: “On the south side the site for an English Church is being marked out [actually this was for the mission church rather than the main church, which was started a few years later], and the rest is a chaos – of houses half built, a mason’s yard, stacks of timber, piles of bricks (of indifferent quality) and unmade roads, with, for sounds, the noise, loud or rasping, of hammer and mallet and saw. In a year or two there will be quiet streets, and dozens of houses with, doubtlessly, wives in most of them waiting according to their temperament, bored, gossiping, or busy through the long day, for their husband’s return”.15

Callers at the Estate Office at Hither Green could pick up a little sales booklet, which gave details of the houses and figures for purchasing the various sizes, from three to six bedrooms: ‘Each house is completely fitted up with Drawing and Dining Room Gasoliers, Hall Lamp and Bedroom Gas Brackets, so that purchasers are saved the usual expense for such fittings… The front gardens are turfed, and trees and shrubs are planted.’ 16

Prices were based on the width of the house frontage. In 1898 you could get a 47ft frontage Villa (6 beds) for £379; a 29ft house (4 beds) for £298; a 24ft frontage 4-bedder for £252; and a 3-bedder (added in 1903) for £248. These prices were Leasehold – you had to pay yearly Ground Rent on top of the purchase price, at around £5 for the 4 bed houses (as a reference, a dustman on the estate earned around 15 shillings a week – £39 a year). To buy your house Freehold you had to multiply the ground rent by 24 and add that sum to the regular purchase price. If those prices sound rather a steal, that’s because by the standards of 2019, they are! Just taking into account regular inflation, a freehold four-bedder (around £400 in 1905) should in today’s money cost around £45,000, but actually would set you back something like 15 times that figure, which gives you an idea of how much the value of property has risen in the last hundred-odd years.

The company bent over backwards to make the houses easy to purchase: as well as the 33% discount for leasehold (recouped by ground rent over the coming years of course), they also offered loans, which presumably came from Corbett’s own resources. A new Act of Parliament in 1899 (the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act) also allowed local Councils to advance mortgages, so someone buying a Corbett house could defray much of the immediate cost through the two loans plus the ground rent. They could then end up paying less per month overall than someone closer in to the centre would pay on rent alone, so maybe it’s not surprising that there were plenty of buyers.

The roads were laid out in a grid (keeping everything in straight lines was the most economical way of building), and Archibald specified that wherever possible they should run north-south, so that morning and evening sunlight was maximised for the occupants. Harking back to his days studying sculpture, he adorned many of the arches over the front doors with a decorative keystone featuring a classical-looking face. There are many different designs, both male and female, and they remain a much-loved feature of the estate. Also perhaps harking back to his youth, he had thousands of lime trees planted in the front gardens, next to the wrought-iron railings topping low walls, which could be a reference to the Parisian boulevards of his continental tour. Or maybe they’re part of his desire to create a healthy environment: the sales booklets boasted of lower death rates on the Corbett estates than the borough-wide averages, and of their often lofty positions above sea level. The gardens (both front and back) were generous, and the Lease specified the duties of a resident in terms of maintenance: ironwork had to be regularly repainted for example, and internal decoration kept up as well.

Of course you could argue that all this was just a sales pitch, or designed to prevent the new estate going downhill and therefore making the houses harder to sell. But if his only focus had been on making money, I think he could have packed in far more houses and charged higher prices.

Another way in which Corbett stamped his mark was to give the 27 streets Scottish names: Duncrievie we’ve already heard of, then there was Hafton (a castle near Cove), Merchiston (a suburb of Edinburgh), Glenfarg (a village in Perthshire), Birkhall (the Scottish retreat of the Prince of Wales) and many more. This shows a confidence and pride in his heritage which was quite different to the royal residences theme his father chose for Woodgrange. Archibald’s son remembers that the ubiquitous Robert Pettigrew was in cahoots with his dad in this matter: “They named the streets on their estates after the villages of their youth – Ardgowan, Wellmeadow, Torridon, Arngask and so on”.17

What emerged in Catford and Hither Green was an ordered community with a variety of house styles to fit the class differences of the day. The “swell road” as Ernest Aves put it (Brownhill) was full of 6-bed villas and in 1911 62% of the houses had at least one live-in servant. That contrasts markedly with the ‘working class’ street of Sandhurst, where less than 2% had servants (although many of the residents were servants elsewhere).

The houses were well-built and there was plenty of greenery, but I’m not sure you could have called it an exciting place to live. There were no pubs and not much open space, but Corbett did try to inject some (healthy) entertainment in the form of a Recreation Ground, right in the centre of the estate, which he opened in 1899. It covered 2 acres and was equipped with 8 tennis courts, 2 bowling greens, and 2 croquet lawns. There was even a fountain in the middle of it all. Residents paid a subscription of 7 shillings and sixpence a year, but for that got access to open-air concerts and sports days as well as the other facilities.

Churches began to spring up due to popular demand: six in all were built on the estate, often preceded by a ‘mission’ building to test the religious waters. If it proved popular, funds could be raised for a more permanent building. The largest, Anglican St Andrews, was opened around 1908 at a cost of roughly £10,000. It’s surely no coincidence that it was named after the patron saint of Scotland.

Schools too were suddenly needed, since the area appealed to those with young families: four were built – at Torridon Road, Sandhurst, Abbotshall (in the playing fields area) and Hazelbank (where the allotments stand today). The latter was a temporary structure of corrugated iron, and probably the Abbotshall one was too.

By April 1911 when the estate was pretty much completed, the 13,569 new residents also had plenty of shopping opportunities at six different parades, on Ardgowan, Muirkirk, Torridon, Sangley, Springbank and Verdant Lane. There were bakers, post offices, fishmongers, tobacconists, watch repairers, hairdressers, oilmen, grocers and more, but very definitely nowhere selling alcohol of any description.

Archibald must have been pretty satisfied. Where 15 years ago there had been farmland, he had created a thriving, alcohol-free estate of low-density, well-built houses with over thirteen thousand inhabitants that was a model of Edwardian respectability.  No doubt he’d also added to his fortune in the process – but whilst this wasn’t primarily a philanthropic project, it wasn’t simply a money-making exercise either. Corbett really had improved the lives of people who wouldn’t otherwise have been able to afford a home of their own.

We opened our doors in October 2016 and between then and May 2019 everything we provided was entirely staffed by volunteers.  In June 2019 we gained Lottery funding to hire two Development Managers who now oversee the day to day running of the library and look at ways to develop income streams so that we can keep our wonderful library and community centre open in the future.

The e-books project is seeking to make this wisdom accessible for Christians world wide in a way that allows rapid discovery of the relevant sections of the text on the one hand and a full preservation of the original document in image format on the other.

Our long term goal is to provide an electronic library which will supplement the physical libraries of pastors around the world. We aim to integrate this material so that relevant passages are quickly provided for any passage of scripture.

The Feminist Library

Main Navigation

The Feminist Library is both a collection of archive and library resources and a community centre. Set up in 1975, the Library remains a space for people to build communities and to celebrate and explore feminism. Our collection supports this aim by focussing on literature from smaller radical publishers, women’s presses and DIY publications to document feminism that is grassroots, accessible and intersectional.



The main Library collection is held at the Sojourner Truth Centre in Peckham and includes:

Non-fiction

Our non-fiction collection consists of about 5,000 books focussing on the period of 

women’s and feminist campaigns between the 1960s and present day. The collection is very strong in the areas of the arts, mental and physical health, social lives, political campaigning and activism, and queer life. Our non-fiction books can be found on our online catalogue. 



Fiction, poetry and drama

We also have about 2,500 works of fiction from all around the world, the majority of which are in English, with some in various European and Latin American languages, including rare small press publications and collected short stories.

Our poetry and drama collections consist of around 1,000 publications, and represents a significant number of little-known and/or self-published poets and playwrights. Our fiction, poetry and drama books can be found on our online catalogue.

Periodicals

The largest collection of feminist journals, magazines and newsletters in the UK, our Periodicals represent a feminist tradition of circulating ideas and supporting and connecting various campaigns with an estimated 1,500 titles. They date from the late 1960s to the present day and include DIY circulated newsletters as well as more widely held journals.

As of 2022 we are working on adding the Periodicals to Koha, our online catalogue, so they are indexed and our holdings defined, but until this is complete we advise checking both the PDFs above and our online catalogue.

Zines

We hold a small but growing collection of around 600 zines. In 2022 we had a custom storage unit built for these and we are cataloguing the titles, previously arranged in boxes by rough subjects, so they can be found alphabetically.

If there is anything about the collection you are unsure of, ask one of our library volunteers who will be happy to answer any questions you may have. For more information on the collections, please contact us.

collections of the Feminist Library can also be viewed at the Bishopsgate Institute. The Bishopsgate Institute is open to the general public and is well worth a visit. These are the collections we have housed at the Bishopsgate Institute:

Pamphlets

We donated our collection of pamphlets to the Bishopsgate in 2009. A radical format used to disseminate ideas quickly and cheaply, the pamphlets cover various topics including labour unions, feminist philosophy, Marxism, women’s health and queer politics.

Posters

The Feminist Library Poster collection is also at Bishopsgate Institute. This consists of around seven hundred posters collected by the Feminist Library over a thirty year period.

Archive

The Feminist Library’s Archive of papers (1976-2004) can also be viewed at the Bishopsgate Institute. This mostly consists of correspondence as well as administrative papers and newsletters. Any collected archives from individuals or groups are also held at Bishopsgate.

Catalogues

Our fiction and non-fiction titles can be searched on our online catalogue. Our periodicals are in the process of being added to the catalogue, so please check there and also our PDF lists of periodicals by title or subject.

We use a unique classification scheme for our non-fiction books devised for the Library by feminist librarian Wendy Davis in the 1970s. It uses women’s issues as its central organising principle and is managed and updated by our team of volunteers.

Please use the Bishopsgate Institute catalogue to search our posters, pamphlets and archive collections.

Visiting the collections

Please check our opening hours and come along to the Library in Peckham, there is no need to book an appointment.

For collections at Bishopsgate Institute please contact them for an appointment."

Being a Friend costs as little as £3 a month. The Feminist Library has never received regular funding, and our Friends are the only reliable source of income we have. As the longest surviving library of our kind, and as a grassroots organisation, we are eternally grateful to our friends for keeping the lights on and keeping Feminist history alive. If every friend paid us £3 a month, it would take 800 friends to cover our basic running costs – that’s rent and three part-time workers on London Living Wage. Be part of living feminist history – become a Friend.

To become a Friend through Enthuse please click here:

Volunteering 

The Feminist Library is run almost entirely by volunteers which is why your help is vital. As well as being home to our ever-growing collection, the Library holds events related to all aspects of feminism so there are many ways to get involved.

If you’d like to offer to help you could join our Volunteering team. We are currently looking for volunteers in many different areas. 

Drop our Volunteer Coordinator Lola an email at volunteer@feministlibrary.co.uk, they will send you a handbook with more information and guide you through your volunteer journey with the Feminist Library. This handbook will share with you the Feminist Library history, and an insight into the types of work you can do while volunteering with us.

As a volunteer, you will be kept up to date with upcoming events and ways to get involved via email and our Library Volunteers Facebook Group, which you are invited to join (if you haven’t already done so!).

We ask you to read the handbook carefully and refer to it whenever questions arise. We encourage you to get in touch with any questions or comments you may have with our volunteer coordinator in person or via email. Any feedback about your volunteer experience is welcome and there are feedback mechanisms to support this.

Who can volunteer with us?

We believe the library should be a space of learning, growth, care and community. As such, much time and energy has been put into thinking about the kind of space we would like to create. Feminism is a complicated and exciting set of ideas, theories and actions – we want people to be able to ask questions, change their minds and develop their practice of feminism with us.

Everyone (trans, cis and intersex), who remains attentive to the community policy is welcome in our space and can volunteer with us. We do not police gender in our spaces.

When you agree to volunteer with us, you agree:

• To help the Library fulfil its aims and objectives

• To perform your volunteering role to the best of your ability and work in partnership with other volunteers

• To follow, support and respect the Feminist Library’s procedures, policies and standards

• To maintain the confidential information of the Feminist Library and our volunteers

• Meet time commitments and standards agreed to and give reasonable notice so other arrangements can be made when this is not possible

• To act responsibly and within the law

• To let the Library know first if you have any problems or complaints so you can be directed to our accountability procedures.

Community • 24 June 2024

We are community-run, serving Brent residents and visitors.
Our 4 Core Aims:
1. To promote literacy and lifelong learning
2. To provide free access to information
3. To support community health and well-being
4. To encourage engagement, creativity and the realisation of potential 

The community re-opened Kensal Rise Library on September 27th 2019,  eight years after Council closure - and exactly 119 years after the original opening by American writer, Mark Twain. 

We campaigned against closure for years, even taking the Council to the High Court. The Council closed the library anyway, despite mass protest and national - and international! -media coverage. 

We continued to fight to regain what had become a void building from the freeholder and developer. Against the odds, we eventually won back most of the ground floor, which otherwise would have been out of community hands forever. 

We then raised hundreds of thousands of pounds from donations, fundraising events and grants to refurbish and equip what had become an empty shell -  creating the beautiful public space Kensal Rise Community Library is today. 
For more details of this extraordinary story, go to About Us/Our History or press orange box below. 



We need your help. We are dependent on donations and volunteers to keep going. 

It costs £100 a day to run the library. Please help keep the library open.

Our volunteers are essential to keeping a library at the heart of our neighbourhood. They give their valuable time to provide free access to books and computers, assisting the Library Manager during shifts, at events and in many other capacities.

To keep in the library loop and receive updates, please subscribe to our mailing list of supporters.

https://kensalriselibrary.org/privacy-policy/,html_files\kensalriselibrary_org_privacy_policy_.html,"The Friends Of Kensal Rise Library (FKRL) is a registered charity that operates a community library called Kensal Rise Library (KRL). This notice is intended to explain how KRL complies with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which became effective from 25th May 2018. The GDPR legally affects how the library handles data and how it  communicates with stakeholders.

KRL treats all aspects of Data Protection seriously and takes active steps in all areas of its work to ensure that all Personal Data which is controlled and processed is appropriately private and secure, in line with current legislation.  

In this note reference is made to “stakeholders”. This term includes library card holders, volunteers, trustees and other parties who may have passed their personal data to KRL at some point.

B – Need for, and use of, Data: 

In order to operate the lending functions of the library, KRL needs to hold information on the library users in its database. The information is taken by a KRL team member when the library card application form is signed by the applicant. This database holds:

Name of card holder(s)

Address

Telephone number

Email contact

Date of Birth

Library card number 

The data is used to operate the applicant’s library card account (and that of any children) and to contact the applicant in case of overdue or lost items.  

KRL’s library system, TinyCat, (see C1 below) also keeps records of all items borrowed and returned, and overdue books.  Bank and credit card data is not kept by the library, and a third party payment system is used whenever payments need to be taken electronically.

KRL also processes data in relation to booking and events, management of the building and equipment (for example, details of those servicing the building), management of donations and for the management of contact lists and communication lists.  

To support diversity and inclusion and to provide required data for funding and grants the library also collects data for statistical purposes, which is anonymous and not connected to any person, for example ethnicity.  Providing this data is entirely voluntary.  

KRL  regards this data as falling under the “legitimate interest” category in the GDPR. 

The library is wholly dependent on the community for support, as it receives no dedicated government or council funding.  The library therefore relies heavily on its donors and needs to keep records of their donations to express appreciation for their support and, (where specifically agreed by the donor completing a Gift Aid form) to collect Gift Aid refunds from HMRC.

KRL manages a database of its Donors.  The information on this Donor database is: 

* Sent to HMRC for Gift Aid Claims. 

KRL also keeps signed Gift Aid forms and copies of standing order mandates in order to be able to respond to queries by both HMRC and the relevant banks.

KRL regards its lawful basis for processing this data as either Legitimate Interest and/or Consent.

In order to be able to inform KRL’s library card holders and also others who have expressed interest about the library, KRL emails newsletters from time to time. It is the only economically practical method. 

Where communication preferences have been expressed, library card holders may be put onto the newsletter database. Other stakeholders who do not have library cards may request to join in order to be kept informed.  The information on this database is: 

KRL regards its lawful basis for processing this data as falling under the “legitimate interest” category in the GDPR and / or consent for marketing (for example, newsletters via email, as required by the Privacy in Electronic Communications Regulations, ‘PECR’

KRL regards this data as falling under “legitimate interest” (a) and “consent” (b, c).

Zadie, who hadn’t been to the library since Brent Council closed it in 2011,  approvingly said: “It’s really changed!” 

She  appreciated  how the community has attractively refurbished and kitted out the albeit, now reduced space. And she noticed on our shelves nine of her own titles, including her latest, The Fraud.

Rap Video Shoot

Zadie was taking part in Doc Brown aka Ben Bailey Smith aka her brother’s video shoot for his latest rap track, Say Less, inside the library.   They were joined by third sibling, Luc, who also appears in the video.

Family Affair left to right: Ben Bailey Smith/Doc Brown, Luc Skyz, Zadie Smith

Doc Brown

Multi-talented and prolific Ben, professionally known as Doc Brown, is a successful singer/songwriter, actor, comedian and of course, writer. Ben has very generously donated six of his own children’s books to our library.

Zadie, who said  using the library before the Council closure had helped her academic career, supported our campaign back in 2011 (see About Us/Our History website page). So we were delighted to welcome her back to see the results of her efforts, along with her talented family.

Please consider leaving a  legacy in your will to the library

You can pass down the benefits of the library to future generations by helping us remain sustainable and secure. 

There is no need to rewrite your will. It is very simple to make a codicil. The two main types of gift through your will are Pecuniary and Residuary legacies. 

A Pecuniary legacy is a gift of a specific sum in you Will, like £1,000. You don’t have to have a lot of money to leave a legacy. We are grateful for anything you can spare. Even a small amount will buy some books on your behalf.

A Residuary legacy is a share of your estate (or the whole of your estate after any specific amounts have been taken away. It is very easy to do. We can provide some wording, but we do recommend that you get legal advice to make sure what’s best for you. 

If you would like to discuss a legacy, please email info@kensalriselibrary.org

We are a well-established charity (reg 1141606) dedicated to keeping open a library in a densely populated area with pockets of deprivation, where there is no other free, public space.

https://kensalriselibrary.org/about-us/,html_files\kensalriselibrary_org_about_us_.html,"Kensal Rise Library is very proud to be the only library in the world opened by the celebrated American writer, Mark Twain – on September 27th 1900. 

It is now run by and for the community via the registered charity, Friends of Kensal Rise Library (FKRL), charity no 1141606.

The community formed FKRL in 2011 to campaign against library closures and in particular, to regain and refurbish historic Kensal Rise Library, following its closure as a public library by Brent Council and subsequent sale by the freeholder, All Souls College, to developers. 

FKRL operates the library independently of the local authority, employing a Library Manager, and relies on public donations and volunteers to keep going.

We aim to maintain an innovative, exciting  library and public space at the heart of our neighbourhood, that is free and welcoming to all in our diverse, crowded community, offering a range of services for both adults and children to further literacy, the arts and community cohesion.

As well as book loans, computers, printing and other library services, we provide a meeting place for local groups and private hire space. Our eclectic range of cultural events adds vibrancy and excellence to community life, and makes the library a destination for visitors from further afield.

Trustees: Chair, Charlie Green; Treasurer, Carole Buck; Secretary, Maria Balinska; Margaret Bailey; Jonathan Bertulis Fenandez; Nicola Christopher; Bola Fatimilehin; John Walsh.

Kensal Rise Library is community-run, serving the people of Brent and its visitors, with a focus on residents living in the three wards of Harlesden and Kensal Green, Queens Park and Brondesbury Park.

Our 4 Core Aims:

1. To promote literacy and lifelong learning

2. To provide free access to information

3. To support community health and well-being

4. To encourage engagement, creativity and the realisation of potential



 Until the mid-1960s, to enter or leave the library you had to pass through the highly polished, wooden check-in/out.  The polish on all that dark wood permeated the building like incense, still fondly remembered: “…and the smell….just so special, ” says Kensal Rise native, Thelma Doyle.

Like an old ship, the check-out’s components were all of an organised complex piece, including long shiny counters behind which the librarians worked, and  myriad pigeon holes for cardboard cards in pastel shades. It was magical – and the best bits moved, making delectable sounds, like the clicketty wooden turnstiles and the heavy date stamp. 

This was also where books thought too racy for the shelves had to be  requested – by means of more wood. “I remember the ‘naughty’ books that were made of wood on the shelves, just showing their title”, says Thelma.  “These had to be taken to the check-out counter to get the real thing – not that I ever borrowed any of those, of course!”. 

Pamela Foster, who worked at the library in the 1960s and lived in Bathurst Gardens, adds: “ I found the wooden books really funny – some were just sex education. ‘Lady Chatterley’ was wood also…how strange to think of that now!” 

The head librarian would judge whether you were sufficiently worthy to swap your wooden dummy for the real thing – which she kept, along with other incendiary titles, primly locked away in the darkest depths of the check-out.

Such prudishness contrasts with a visit, 30 years later, recalled by Anne Mullane, who was a library assistant in the 1990s: “On the day Fred was leaving, we were working upstairs and it was announced that someone important had arrived for him.  

“We could hardly believe our eyes when a woman in a raincoat – a stripper – was ushered in.  We female librarians were sent downstairs.  The men didn’t even have the decency to look ashamed! She was up there for ages! Different times, I guess. 

“I think Brent’s library management didn’t know the HALF of what went on in their libraries! … And I bet that stripper never worked in another library – before, or since!”

Thelma  recalls the library’s layout: “I can remember when there was a staircase up the middle to the Children’s Library on the first floor to the right, the library check in/out in the middle of the ground floor at the base of the stairs, the silent reading room was downstairs on the left and the general library to the right”.

Pamela says: “All the lending areas were downstairs; upstairs was where the new books were processed, and the Schools Library was upstairs too. If you went another floor up to the attic, there were really old books there. I wonder what happened to all of them…?



This cute, contextual  animation takes the campaign up to when we were appealing to All Souls College Oxford to return the building to the community.  


To be continued as we complete our new website… 

Mark Twain was already a renowned transatlantic celebrity when he opened Kensal Rise Library on September 27th  1900. So this was a considerable coup for the little London neighbourhood. Twain is still widely recognised  as one of America’s greatest writers and we are extremely proud of this unique history. You can see a photograph of Twain with the Library Committee, displayed near the front door. 

Twain had spent the summer at nearby Dollis Hill House, in what is now Gladstone Park. As part of the opening ceremony, Twain gave five of his own books to the Chair of the Library Committee.  What became of those precious volumes is a mystery!  In return, Twain  was presented with an inscribed silver key, now owned by scholar/collector Kevin MacDonnell in Texas, who acquired them from Twain’s daughter.  

Locals requested the site for a Public Reading Room/Library from major landowner, All Souls College, which was greatly profiting from the area’s rapid development in the 19th century.  On strict condition that the site could only be used to build a reading room or library, All Souls donated the land to commemorate Queen Victoria’s Jubilee in 1896. 

Money to build the reading room came from public subscription and local taxes – not All Souls College.

The reading room was immediately popular: in the first week after Twain’s opening, 80 people a day used it to read papers, rising to 150 after 6 months. Books came to be donated – an  act of generosity that resonates with today’s public, who have donated almost all the books on our shelves.

By 1901, such was the demand that the library committee appealed for money to enlarge the building, asking  the then famously richest man in the world – Andrew Carnegie, the Scots-American steel magnate and philanthropist, who endowed over 2,500 libraries globally.  Carnegie happened to be a good friend of Mark Twain, which may be why he responded with a grant of £3,000 in September 1903. The result – the attractive, redbrick building you see today  at the crossroads of Bathurst Gardens and College Road (both named after All Souls College), was officially opened in 1904. The plaque commemorating both Carnegie and Mark Twain hangs today by the library’s front door. 

In 1922, Kensal Rise Library became the first in the borough of Willesden to allow people to choose their own books from the shelves, instead of librarians fetching them from storage – censored books excluded (see ‘naughty books and other memories’ above). In 1928, an extension was built between the original building and the first house in Bathurst Gardens. 

In 1934, a  Children’s Library was established  on the first floor. This was decorated with murals from children’s literature, painted by Dudley Holland and the celebrated Maurice de Sausmarez (later, teacher and partner of Bridget Riley), while they were still students at Willesden College of Art. Very sadly, these murals were lost in the Council’s night raid in 2012 (see below).

During World War II, the building suffered minor damage from heavy bombing, due to the neighbourhood’s proximity to the railway. At night,  fire watchers sat in the attic windows surveilling the views across London to St Paul’s.  The ‘war effort’ also claimed the  library’s iron railings, which were removed from the perimeter wall,  possibly for munitions. 

In 1964 there were major structural changes, including, sadly,  the removal of the handsome stone staircase, the wooden check-in/check-out (see ‘naughty books and other memories’ above) and the mosaic floor in the entrance lobby; the courtyard was also filled in. The Children’s Library moved downstairs to the 1928 extension. The vacated rooms upstairs were eventually used by the Schools Library Service, after responsibility for the library passed to the newly formed London Borough of Brent in April 1965.

In 1988 Brent Council was making cutbacks and as a branch library, Kensal Rise was threatened  with closure. In protest, locals occupied the premises. Parents and children slept overnight on the library floor. The Council was about to sell the building to a Japanese property company,  but protest leaders rediscovered  the All Souls’ covenant, protecting the building’s use as a reading room/library. The Council capitulated, refurbished the library, and it lived on in public hands…

..Until 2010, when the Council once again announced closure plans – this time  of  half the borough’s 12 libraries. In response,  the community formed the campaigning charity, Friends of Kensal Rise Library (FKRL). It created a business plan setting out how the community could  run the library, organised public meetings, petitions, fundraising events and diverse other interventions. 

The campaign was fought for many years; a collective community response attracting national and international media attention and the support of notables, including  writers like Alan Bennett, Zadie Smith, Philip Pullman and Jacqueline Wilson, performers such as Tamsin Greig and  Alexi Sayle, and politicians including Alan Johnson.

“Closing libraries is child abuse. Libraries have to be local. They have to be handy. They shouldn’t need an expedition.”

Early on, the case was even taken to the High Court, but a judicial review challenge and its appeal were dismissed, and in 2011, the library doors were locked.

The Council then came to take the books, ignoring the All Soul’s covenant whereby without the books, the entire building would  revert to the College (which had not paid a penny to build it).  However, the campaigners – including children from the local primary school –   kept guard every day outside, and the council’s removal men left empty-handed. 

 

Fearing further confrontation, in the dead of night and with police reinforcement, in May 2012 council officials seized the books and the totemic original plaque commemorating Mark Twain and Andrew Carnegie. The library’s other treasures, the de Sausmarez and Dudley murals, were lost in the raid – and the entire building, which had been public for over 100 years, reverted to All Souls College.

 “The wanton destruction of the Kensal Rise Library – its books removed, its history erased – is a gross act of philistinism which will bring lasting shame to all involved, ” 

Undeterred, FKRL created a  pop-up library outside, with books, toys and games donated – and enthusiastically used by – local residents, writers and publishers. Under makeshift awnings, rain or shine, books were loaned out by volunteers who had swiftly organised a shift system. There were adults’ and children’s sections, bisected on the crossroads by a city piano. This continued to prove the need for a library on the site, and retained the press and wider public’s  interest  in that need.

Despite FKRL’s appeal to All Souls to return the building to the public (which had paid for it), the College sold the building to developer, Platinum Revolver. However, due to FKRL’s campaign, as a condition of the sale, All Souls stipulated that part of the ground floor must be  reserved for the community.  FKRL then managed to extend that community space  at Brent Council’s Planning Committee to two thirds of the ground floor. In addition, FKRL negotiated with the College a peppercorn rent for the lease, 10 days shy of 1,000 years. The rest of the building is now private apartments. Without FKRL, what is now Kensal Rise Library would have been out of community hands forever.

We then To be continued….

This year’s event, in memory of the late actress, Haydn Gwynne, became especially emotional when Haydn’s son, Orlando (6th from left in image above of the curtain call), read a poem his mother left him. The actors chose poems and prose Haydn had performed over the past decade at other Kensal Rise Library fundraisers, along with those on the theme of friendship. The performers included Ben Miles and Paterson Joseph. Heartfelt thanks to all in the extraordinary, extensive cast. (See full list below.)

The night’s success was due also to our wonderful volunteers who greeted the audience and ran the stalls: Alex, Fiona, Hitesh, Josephine, Julie, Kathy and Viv. Thanks also to Kathy for her beautiful bags and to Fiona for baking such delicious cakes. And we are indebted to Alex, for not only running the bar with Julie, but also for wrangling Berkmann Wine’s very generous donation of fine wines.

Finally, our thanks to Rick Leaf and Rev Graham Noyce, whose collaboration with the library helped make this unique, warm, community evening of excellence and emotion so memorable.

In 2015 we reopened as a community-run library, staffed by volunteers and funded almost entirely by donations. In 2019 we were shortlisted and ‘highly commended’ in The Bookseller magazine’s Library of the Year Awards.

Preston Community Library is a secular community space that is open to all. Drop in, read a book, surf the internet, make a friend, join an event. We’ll be waiting for you here.

The event offered health checks, arts and crafts, cookery demonstrations and many other activities. Funds raised were shared between the Mayor’s two charities – Preston Community Library and PLIAS Resettlement.

Preston Community Library is required to process relevant personal data regarding members of staff, volunteers, and members as part of its operation and shall take all reasonable steps to do so in accordance with this Policy. 

The Library ‘Chair’ and ‘Committee’ acting as the Data Protection Controller (DPC) who will endeavour to ensure that all personal data is processed in compliance with this Policy and the Principles of the Data Protection Act 1998. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 are also relevant to parts of this policy. 

The Library recognises The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) adopted 27 April 2016, the two-year transition period and the application date of 25 May 2018 and is actively working towards compliance with that directive. 

The Library shall so far as is reasonably practicable comply with the Data Protection Principles (the Principles) contained in the Data Protection Act to ensure all data is:- 

Personal data covers both facts and opinions about an individual where that data identifies an individual. For example, it includes contact information necessary for engagement such as the volunteers’s name and address and may require details for reimbursement of expenses. Personal data may also include sensitive personal data as defined in the Act.

Consent may be required for the processing of personal data unless processing is necessary for the performance of the volunteer’s duties. Any information which falls under the definition of personal data and is not otherwise exempt, will remain confidential and will only be disclosed to third parties with appropriate consent.

Children below the age of consent, consent to process their data and disclose it to parents is implicit until they reach the age of 18. If a child wishes to revoke or change consent they must agree a specific agreement on how their data is to be processed with the data processor.

The Library may photograph and record activities and events for promotional and fund-raising purposes and may use images and process some personal data (in statistical form only) for direct marketing and fund-raising purposes, data subjects have the right, and will be given the opportunity, to request an opt-out to these activities, which must be respected.

Preston Community Library does not generally require to process sensitive personal data. Sensitive personal data includes data relating to medical information, gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, trade union membership and criminal records and proceedings. We will only require to process such information when it pertains to suitability to carry out certain duties.

Data subjects have the right of access to information held by the Library, subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Any data subject wishing to access their personal data should put their request in writing to the DPO. The Library will endeavour to respond to any such written requests as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event, within 40 days for access to records and 21 days to provide a reply to an access information request. The information will be imparted to the data subject as soon as is reasonably possible after it has come to the Library’s attention and in compliance with the relevant Acts.

Certain data is exempted from the provisions of the Data Protection Act which includes the following:- 

The above are examples only of some of the exemptions under the Act. Any further information on exemptions should be sought from the DPC.

The Library will endeavour to ensure that all personal data held in relation to all data subjects is accurate. Data subjects must notify the data processor of any changes to information held about them. Data subjects have the right in some circumstances to request that inaccurate information about them is erased. This does not apply in all cases, for example, where records of mistakes or corrections are kept, or records which must be kept in the interests of all parties to which they apply.

An appropriate level of data security must be deployed for the type of data and the data processing being performed. In most cases, personal data must be stored in appropriate systems and be encrypted when transported off-site. Other personal data may be for publication or limited publication within the Library, therefore having a lower requirement for data security.

Any reported breach will be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner, with further action taken to prevent any reoccurrence.

‘Armstrong is nothing short of incredible… It is an exceptional piece of theatre. Everyone should see it.’
Independent on Sunday

A villain? A victim? Or something even more intriguing? The tragic, funny, and often unbelievable life, of fiction’s most famous Jew.
The play confronts and confounds the stereotypes through the eyes of Shylock’s only friend – Tubal, who proves a born comic storyteller. Celebrating the richness of Shakespeare’s
language and conjuring up a whole cast of characters, this dazzling, moving, and often hilarious play is a fascinating exploration of Shylock and his people.

VOICES FROM METROLAND. The Project is looking at the history of our area, recording memories and collecting images of buildings and places that have disappeared – and looking at the green spaces that have survived. It’s amazing to think that Preston had farmland within living memory.

WE ARE PRESTON! VOICES FROM METROLAND is one of several projects in the Being Brent programme funded by the Heritage Fund. Our project includes video and audio recordings of conversations with local people, history walks and a series of public events. During the coming year, we will be adding links to recordings and a photo gallery of our activities. We would like to thank both our funders and all the people who came forward to share their memories – helping us to take a fresh look at the places we pass every day.

Cruel Separation is the story of the military coup in Chile on 11 September 1973 from the point of view of four women who lived through it: Hortensia Bussi de Allende, widow of President Salvador Allende; Joan Jara, widow of political singer-songwriter, Victor Jara; Joyce Horman, whose story was made famous in the award-winning film Missing; Angela Jeria de Bachelet, widow of a General loyal to President Allende, whose daughter later became President following Chile’s return to democracy. Narrated by Donald Sutherland, the film won the award for best international documentary in 2006. The director, Sarah Boston, will introduce the film and be available to answer questions.

https://prestoncommunitylibrary.org/about/,html_files\prestoncommunitylibrary_org_about_.html,"Our aim is to provide a local public library service, together with a wide range of social, cultural and educational activities, in a secular community space which is open to all. Preston Community Library is run entirely by volunteers.

The Friends of Preston Library formed in 2011, in response to Brent Council’s planned closure of Preston Library and five other Brent libraries. A group of individuals who did not know each other were quickly united in our opposition to the closures. The group successfully campaigned to raise funds to challenge the legality of the closures in the High Court and subsequently in the Court of Appeal, but Brent closed all six libraries – including Preston Library – in October 2011.

A huge, and hugely impressive, campaign against the closures continued for several years, and in 2015 we reopened as Preston Community Library – a library and community space run entirely by volunteers, and funded almost entirely by donations.

In addition to a full library service for adults and children, we have hosted a wide range of cultural events and activities, including yoga, Arabic, Italian, ESOL, IT and art classes, story time for under-fives, a knitting group, a chess club and our community cinema. We have run events in partnership with organisations including Brent Council, Central and NW London Health Trust, Film London, Librarian Theatre, LOCO London Comedy Film Festival, Preston Park Primary School and University College London. Guest speakers have included Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Brownlow and Women’s Prize-winning novelist Kamila Shamsie.

In 2019 Preston Community Library was shortlisted for The Bookseller magazine’s Library of the Year Award and was ‘highly commended’. The judges recognised ‘the commitment and hard work shown by volunteers who keep a form of library provision in their community against the odds.’

The library currently operates from temporary premises in Ashley Gardens, while the original library site is being redeveloped. We hope to move back into the new library in Carlton Avenue East in the spring of 2023.

We are here for everyone!

VOICES FROM METROLAND. The Project is looking at the history of our area, recording memories and collecting images of buildings and places that have disappeared – and looking at the green spaces that have survived. It’s amazing to think that Preston had farmland within living memory.

WE ARE PRESTON! VOICES FROM METROLAND is one of several projects in the Being Brent programme funded by the Heritage Fund. Our project includes video and audio recordings of conversations with local people, history walks and a series of public events. During the coming year, we will be adding links to recordings and a photo gallery of our activities. We would like to thank both our funders and all the people who came forward to share their memories – helping us to take a fresh look at the places we pass every day.

Held in the Library and grounds at Ashley Gardens

It was 4 years since we last held a Summer Fun Day for our community at our home in Carlton Avenue East. With only a few short weeks to plan, arrange and publicise the event, there was some concern, as to whether we had done enough to persuade anyone to turn up! All doubts were swept away as the day turned out to be another triumph for our volunteers and supporters. The day was sunny and warm, as our stalwart early birds opened up in the morning and began preparing the Library and grounds – cleaning, moving tables and chairs, putting up signs and preparing refreshments to ensure everything was ready for the 12:00pm start. There were raffle prizes to display and the ‘Guess how many sweets in the jar’ competition, with the secret answer in a carefully sealed envelope, to set up. The Children’s entertainer and the Face Painter arrived. Mats were laid out under the Old Oak Tree (estimated to be around 200 years old!) for Storytime and Rhyme. The ‘BookAway’ table and the ‘Plant sale’ stall, beautifully arranged with some lovely healthy specimens, were set up. Volunteers from The Jason Roberts Foundation came along to provide Putting practice and Football activities. Our Yoga instructor interrupted her work schedule to give a taster session. Papa Gee’s Crazy Ice Cream Tank was parked by the gate. Our Brent North MP, Barry Gardiner, and Councillors Orleen Hylton, Sunita Hirani and Ryan Hack arrived to support the event. Barry graciously agreed to draw our raffle and announce the winner of the sweetie competition. When the gate was opened, there was already a small crowd gathered, and within a few minutes more families arrived and the grounds began to fill up. The next three hours flew by as more and more people came – it was great to see so many happy faces (some beautifully painted) having fun and enjoying all the activities. There was an unexpected twist in the tale of the sweetie competition: the result was two entries with the same number, each guessing 500. There were 493 in the jar, so we had to split the contents between the two winners, with a large consolation bag of sweets, for each of the two runners-up. At the end of the day, we started the clear-up, getting the Library ready for normal opening the following Saturday. A resounding ‘three cheers’ are owed to all our volunteers, sponsors and supporters who worked so hard to make the day a success. The event raised almost £300 for the Library funds.

In 2012 The Winch took over the Belsize Community Library from Camden Council, who were on the verge of closing it down.  It was clearly important to keep it as a library, and that’s exactly what The Winch has done. Today it remains the beautiful Belsize Park space that it has been since it was built in 1937. We welcome everyone in the local community and beyond! 

Become a Member. Becoming a member is easy! You can do it in person at the library, please bring proof of address with you.

As we are an independent library we can’t accept Camden Library cards.

Maybe it’s your first reading experience or you’re just learning. You might be an adult who wants to discover new authors. We invite you to do that here – we’ve got lots of books to help you on your reading journey. 

Belsize Book Club takes place the last Monday of the month 2pm – 3.30pm

We Create



All our visitors can be creative and have fun! Come and explore what you can do to develop your creative potential. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never done it before – you could learn new skills. We welcome everyone of all ages to take a break from your normal routine, step inside the library and find yourself something creative to learn and love.

Craft club is on Wednesdays 1pm-4pm and are for creatives to get together and learn skills from each other!

It has been built up and developed over the past four decades with funding and guidance from His Highness Aga Khan IV.

This bibliographical project intends to collect and distribute multilingual summaries of scientific publications first published in vernacular languages of Muslim-majority countries. Our goal is to close the gap between different scholarly traditions, and offer a tool for scientists and librarians to expand their resources while promoting the scientific work of researchers outside of Western academia.

The MCA project has published three books since its inception in 2009. In its current development under the Aga Khan Library, it will become an online database.

Opening hours: Monday to Friday from 9:30 to 18:30

The Aga Khan Library houses thousands of rare and unique items. Our special collections include manuscripts, artworks, out-of-print publications, photographs and maps produced in different periods and areas of the Muslim world. We are also the custodian of several research libraries and personal archives donated by acclaimed scholars in the field of Islamic studies.

These essential collections were donated by the late professors Annemarie Schimmel and Peter Avery, and continue to be donated by the director of The Institute of Ismaili Studies, Dr Farhad Daftary. Our library has also benefitted from the kind donation of the personal archive and library of the late Professor Mohammed Arkoun

Comprehensively catalogued, the Arkoun Archive includes Mohammed Arkoun’s personal and professional papers, offering a complete picture of an outstanding intellectual character recognised by his peers and beyond.

The Arkoun Archive includes documents tracing Mohammed Arkoun’s early childhood, education, academic career, and involvement with global institutions. In addition, the Arkoun Archive also contains preparatory work for his teaching and lecturing activities as well as countless research notes and drafts of his publications. A substantial part of the archive consists of Professor Arkoun’s professional correspondence with fellow scholars, religious and political leaders, as well as personal letters to family and friends

In 2019, the Aga Khan Library began developing a digital collections platform. The project displays, preserves and facilitates research into a selection of materials from our special collections.

To date, the platform offers more than 200 high-quality digitisations of rare materials to researchers all over the world.

The Aga Khan Library team is here to help you find relevant materials for research and teaching, access library resources, and resolve queries about your library account.

The reference service collaborates with teaching staff to ensure students can access course-specific resources for their coursework and research. Tailored reference and library research skills training is available to students and faculty.

Our librarians also carry out induction sessions for students as part of Orientation Week. We extend these to new staff, researchers and students during the academic year.

Our reference services operate on an ad-hoc basis, and you can access them in person or online. Librarians are available at the reference desk from 10:00 am to 5:30 pm.

Users can request a meeting with a librarian for individual in-depth research assistance sessions.

These sessions focus on specific research topics, and how the collections and resources of the Aga Khan Library can support you. The sessions also provide tools and information to help you manage research literature, avoid plagiarism and create bibliographies.

In addition to individual reference sessions, our librarians deliver workshops on different topics during the year. These include citing and referencing, plagiarism and copyright, use of electronic resources, advanced information retrieval, and more.

Every year, we publish a calendar with the dates for these workshops. If you cannot attend a particular session, our librarians might be able to add new dates or arrange individual sessions with you. Please contact the reference desk to discuss your scheduling enquiries.

Our research and subject guides are detailed documents that help you explore specific topics and collections of the Aga Khan Library.

The guides offer an overview of the materials available in our collection, and help you navigate them more efficiently.

Other librarians are free to reuse, copy and distribute our research and subject guides with the correct attribution.

Our spaces are open for study, a place to meet friends, to start up a new business or to get inspired by visiting our galleries and events.

We're continuing to experience a major technology outage as a result of a cyber-attack. Our buildings are open as usual, however, the outage is still affecting our website, online systems and services, as well as some onsite services. This is a temporary website, with limited content outlining the services that are currently available, as well as what's on at the Library.

Search our online catalogue to find most of our printed collections and some freely available online resources, but not everything is available.

Our Reading Rooms in London and Yorkshire are open, but access to our collection and online resources is limited.

Our buildings in London and Yorkshire are open as usual. Find our opening hours, facilities and access information.

Start-up, protect or grow your business. Our centres across the UK offer expert advice for all stages of your business journey.

We're now able to confirm restoration dates for some of our key services. You'll be able to access more content, view digitised manuscripts and request items remotely again this September. Our CEO Sir Roly Keating explains more in his latest blog.

When our new system for requesting collection items is launched in September you'll need a Reader Pass which has been issued or renewed since 21 March 2024 to use it. We recommend renewing beforehand if you can, so you're ready for launch. Find out more

Our latest exhibition is the first major exhibition of its kind anywhere in the world, travelling back five centuries to discover the layered Black experiences that have birthed a thriving musical culture and history. Beyond the Bassline opens 26 April and you can book your tickets today.

https://www.bl.uk/foi/,html_files\www_bl_uk_foi_.html,"The Freedom of Information Act 2000 gives a general right of access to recorded information held by public authorities and obliges them to disclose information, subject to a range of exemptions.

Applicants have the right:

Under the Freedom of Information Act you can request recorded information that is held by the British Library.

To make a request under the Act, please send us an email, letter or a fax requesting the information and, provided it is not covered by one of the exemptions in the Act, we will provide you with that information as soon as possible, or in any event within 20 working days.

Requests must be made in writing and include the following details:

Please be as specific as possible about the information you would like to request even where you do not know the names of particular documents.

If your request is unclear, or we cannot identify the information you are interested in, we will write back to you to ask for clarification.

We will aim to acknowledge your request promptly and provide you with details about when your can expect to receive our response.

Please email us at FOI-Enquiries@bl.uk

While you are entitled to request any information we hold, the Act provides a number of exemptions that allow information to be withheld in certain circumstances. If we decide that we cannot release the information requested, we will explain which exemption is relevant in this case.

One of the aims of the Freedom of Information Act is that all public authorities should be clear and proactive about the information they make available. Section 19 of the Act requires the preparation of a Publication Scheme which sets out:

The aim of this Publication Scheme is to explain what information the Library makes available to the public as a matter of course, and to make it available online. The British Library does not charge for any of the information within the scope of its Publication Scheme. The Scheme will be periodically reviewed, amended and updated to include additional published information.

Overall responsibility for this Scheme is taken by the Strategic Leadership Team, which oversees all aspects of Freedom of Information implementation in the British Library. The Strategic Leadership Team has delegated day-to-day responsibility for the operation of the Scheme to the Head of Corporate Information Management.

Information available via our Publication Scheme is the copyright of the British Library Board unless otherwise indicated. The British Library complies with the Re-Use of Public Sector Information (amendment) Regulations 2015 and we encourage the re-use of the information that we produce, hold and disseminate. You are free to copy, publish, distribute, transmit, adapt, or exploit the information in our Publication Scheme in any way you choose, but you must attribute the British Library Board as the source of the information.

The PSI Regulations establish a set of rules that govern the re-use of material held or used by public bodies as part of their Public Task. The British Library makes most of its re-usable material available via our commercial services:

For commercial licensing please contact Sam Tillet (Head of Licensing).

For any other requests for re-use of our content, or for complaints about licensing or re-use decisions under the Regulations, please email us at FOI-Enquiries@bl.uk

We are grateful for any comments you may have about our Publication Scheme. Please email us at FOI-Enquiries@bl.uk or contact us at the address below:

If you are dissatisfied with our response to your request for information, you have a right to an internal review, conducted by someone who was not involved in the handling of your request.

Any written expression of dissatisfaction associated with our response to a request handled under the above legislation will be considered a complaint and request for an internal review.

Information Access complaints received by the Library will be referred to as an 'Internal Review' and handled by the Library's Corporate Information Management Unit (CIMU).

Wherever possible, Internal Reviews will be conducted by someone who was not involved in handling the original request, although it will usually be necessary to consult the original request handler for further information on how the request was dealt with. The reviewer will have an appropriate level of seniority and expertise.

When necessary and appropriate to do so, a Chief Officer of the Library will convene an internal review panel in order to investigate your complaint. Wherever possible, the Chief Office chairing this panel would not have been involved in the decision making process for the initial request.

Following the review, the Library will write to the complainant setting out its decision and the reasons for the decision made. Wherever possible or necessary, our Internal Review will seek clarify the initial decision, provide any additional advice and assistance to the applicant, and, in the appropriate circumstance, to revisit whether or not any additional information can be provided.

If you are still not satisfied following an internal review, you can make a complaint to the Information Commissioners Office.

Information Commissioner's OfficeWycliffe HouseWater LaneWilmslowCheshireSK9 5AF

Alternatively, you can submit a complaint on their website: https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/foi-and-eir-complaints/foi-and-eir-complaints/

Yes, you can save and exit as many times as you wish. Just make sure you are aware of the closing date of the vacancy you are applying for so you can complete your application before the vacancy closes.

Disability Confident is a government scheme designed to encourage employers to recruit and retain disabled people and individuals with health conditions. The British Library is a Disability Confident employer. This means we have made a commitment to recruit and support disabled people. We guarantee an interview for disabled candidates who meet the minimum essential criteria for the role.

When there is an update on your applications status, we will send you an email to notify you. However, you can check the status of your application at any time by logging into the candidate portal.

Once submitted, you won't be able to amend your application, but you can go back in and download your current application, withdraw the incorrect application and resubmit a new one.

If you have been shortlisted for an interview, you will receive an email inviting you to attend an interview. All the details you need to know will be included in this email including the date, time and location of your interview, who you will be meeting and what, if anything, you need to bring or prepare for.

Please note you will receive email correspondence from us regardless of the outcome of your application.

Wherever possible we will seek to make reasonable adjustments that allow you to feel comfortable at your interview and enable you to perform to your full potential.

We will listen to you to try and understand your circumstances and discuss potential adjustments that may be accommodated.

The British Library carries out competency-based interviews in line with our values-based approach to recruitment. You will be asked a series of questions by the interview panel that will seek to build an understanding of your skillset and previous experience. You will also be invited to ask questions of your own at the end of the interview.

You will hear back regarding the outcome of your interview either by phone or email. If you have been successful, you will receive a written conditional offer from our Employee Services Recruitment team outlining the main details of the role and what the next steps are regarding recruitment checks.

If you have been unsuccessful, you will receive an email from the Employee Services Recruitment team informing you of this. You have the right to request feedback and this will be provided to you upon request.

The timeline for pre-employment checks can vary depending on the individual and the role they have applied for. Therefore, it isnât possible to say how long this may take for you.

There are several elements that make up the pre-employment process. The checks involved include a Right to Work Check, DBS check, health assessment and receiving suitable references. Our Employee Services Recruitment team will inform you of what you need to provide to them as part of this process.

You will also receive a link to our onboarding portal where you will be asked to complete some new starter information so the sooner you complete any information asked of you the sooner the checks are likely to be completed.

No, we will send a link for you to complete an online health questionnaire.

Weâd love you to start tomorrow! However, the British Library needs to ensure that all relevant checks are completed and considered satisfactory before you can start your employment with us. A start date will be discussed with you during your recruitment checks or shortly after these are completed.

This varies, as the time checks take to be completed can vary from a couple of days to a few weeks on average.

If you are on a five-week notice period, or less, we recommend handing your notice in once your pre-employment checks are completed and the hiring manager has arranged a start date with you.

If you don't want us to contact your current reference until you have handed your notice in, please inform bl-recruitment@bl.uk as soon as possible after accepting your offer.

If you are on a three-month notice period, you can hand in your notice once you have accepted your offer, because itâs very rare that the pre-employment checks take this long.

Please email bl-recruitment@bl.uk and they will be able to re-set your access.

Please go to Employer forms - Civil Service Pension Scheme and select the pension questionnaire option within the âNew entrants and rejoinersâ section.

https://www.bl.uk/privacy/,html_files\www_bl_uk_privacy_.html,"This policy outlines our obligations and your rights under data protection legislation. It applies to all interactions you may have with the British Library, for example visiting our website, using our systems (such as our free Wi-Fi), or visiting our buildings.

This is an abridged version of the Privacy Policy found on our main website (which is currently unavailable during this period of disruption). We will revert to our full policy when our website and services are restored. 

The nature and types of personal information we collect and process from you will depend on which of our Services you choose to use. We will normally collect personal information directly from you when you volunteer it to us, or when we gather it from your use of our Services. We try to limit our use of personal information to the details we need to provide the requested or agreed Service for you.

If you have visited the Library, registered as a Reader, attended a Library event, contacted the Library, or otherwise signed-up to use one of our services, this may include the following categories of personal data:

Where you have previously used or accessed the Library's website (prior to the cyber incident in October 2023), or used the Library's Wi-Fi, the Library may also collect and process:

This list is not intended to be exhaustive and may be updated from time to time as our business needs and legal requirements dictate.

Where it is necessary and lawful to do so, we may also collect information from and/or combine your personal information with information from other sources.

We do not normally collect any Sensitive Personal Information from or about you, and do not wish to do so unless it is essential. If we do, we will only ask you to provide the minimum amount of information required for that purpose. In other cases, we will collect and use this type of information only with your clear consent. Please do not provide us with Sensitive Personal Information under any other circumstances.

We may collect your personal information through our Data Collection Media whenever you use any of our Services, including using our website or visiting our buildings. This would include when you:

In certain circumstances, the British Library may also collect your personal information from (and/or combine it with information from) other sources, such as:

We may also occasionally collect personal information from public sources where it is fair and lawful to do so. For example, we may use publicly available information to track down the owner of certain intellectual property rights. These sources may include internet search-engine results, publicly available data from Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and similar social media, or other information in the public domain.

The Library may use your personal information for a variety of purposes, depending upon the Service you have requested or are using. Quite often we will use your data simply to fulfil a request that you have initiated, such as to deal with your enquiry, give you access to the Library, provide a requested book to you, send you tickets to an event, or otherwise to provide you with and enable you to use our Services. You may also choose to share certain information with us as part of a research project or a joint academic collaboration.

The Library may also use your personal information to manage and develop the Services that we offer, for example to:

The Library may also use personal data to ensure we can meet our legal, regulatory and good governance obligations, such as to:

Where you have given your consent we may use your contact details to send you direct marketing communications (including e-mail marketing and fundraising communications), or run marketing campaigns, competitions, prize draws and promotions

Under data protection legislation, the British Library is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason (known as a 'legal basis') to do so. The 'legal basis' relied on to process the personal data we hold will depend on the way in which you have engaged with the Library, or the Service or product you use or sign up for. We may process your personal data because:

Depersonalised or aggregated information does not personally identify you. We may also convert personal information into depersonalised (âpseudonymousâ) data or anonymous data for statistical analysis and administration, tailoring products and Services, risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to our Services (normally on an aggregated statistical basis).

The Library will take appropriate steps to ensure your personal information will only be made available to those members of our staff who need to see it in order to perform their functions/roles/responsibilities at the Library in respect of the Services you have requested or agreed to use.

Personal information may be held in one or more Customer Relationship Management (CRM) databases to ensure we have clear and accurate records about your use of our Services, to help understand your requirements, and how we might provide other Services to you.

We will never use information about the specific Collection Items that you have requested during your use of our Collections (e.g., through use of our Reading Rooms or our remote Services such as Document Supply) to provide marketing analysis or to send personalised marketing material. We may use this information on an aggregated and depersonalised basis for Service improvement purposes (for example, to determine whether we are purchasing enough journals in a specific foreign language to match our Readers' research interests).

The Library engages various expert third-party service providers to assist with the performance of certain functions or to provide services on our behalf. These third party service providers may act as âData Processorsâ, processing your personal information on our behalf in order to assist the Library, or to provide an agreed Service to you. All of our Data Processors are bound by strict contractual terms in order to ensure that your personal information will be protected appropriately.

The Library may be required to share your personal information with other people and organisations outside the Library to the extent permitted or required by law. This may include:

Where we are required to share your personal information with a third party, you will be informed of the identity and location of the relevant recipient, either at the point of data collection, or in in the Service specific pages available on our website.

Where we (or a Data Processor acting on our behalf) transfer your personal information to countries outside of the EEA, we will put in place appropriate measures (as required by law) to ensure that those transfers are adequately protected. Where this is in relation to a specific Service you will be informed of the identity and location of the relevant recipient, either at the point of data collection, or in in the Service specific pages available on our website.

 We may contact you with information that may affect your use of a service, for example, disruptions to Services, reading room closures, lost property, or problems with orders. You will not be able to unsubscribe from administrative and Service-related communications unless you unsubscribe from the relevant Services.

The Library would like to provide you with information about new Services, products, events, courses, collections, promotions and offers from the Library which may be of interest to you. We may contact you to tell you this information, but we will obtain your consent before contacting you with âdirect marketingâ in this way.

Any direct marketing communications that you receive from the Library will include a simple way for you to decline or change your mind about further marketing, such as an 'unsubscribe' link, or an email address to which you can send an opt-out request. The Library will take steps to stop any direct marketing to which you object, or in respect of which you withdraw your consent, within one calendar month being told of your objection or withdrawal of consent.

Following the cyber-attack on Library systems in October 2023, we have taken targeted protective measures to ensure the integrity of our systems, and we are undertaking a forensic investigation with the support of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Metropolitan Police and cybersecurity specialists. We are actively assessing all of our information security provisions in line with the recommendations from the NCSC and our partners and we have implemented additional security measures to defend against future attacks.

You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information, although in some cases these rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations. You are entitled to:

If you would like more details about these rights as they apply to a specific Service of the British library, or to exercise any of your rights, please contact us by emailing dp@bl.uk or writing to:

Corporate Information Management UnitThe British Library96 Euston Road LondonNW1 2DB

To help us identify the personal information you are referring to, please include any details that will enable us to locate the relevant personal information, such as your Reader Number or details of how you have previously engaged with the Library.

We may contact you to ask you to provide a form of identification (e.g., a driving license, utility bill or passport) so that we can be sure we do not provide personal data to the wrong person.

We will aim to provide you with our response within one calendar month of the Library accepting your request and we will tell you if it is necessary to extend this time period.

If after receiving a reply from us you are still unhappy with our response to such a request you may complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Details on how to do so can be found on the ICO's website.

The Library will only keep your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained. Where this is in relation to a specific Service you will be informed of the retention period, either at the point of data collection, or in the Service specific pages available on our website.

When the Library decides that holding your details is no longer necessary we will securely delete / destroy your details.

We will keep your details on record until we have completely dealt with your request, enquiry, or our contract with you, and then for a reasonable period afterwards, in accordance with data protection and other applicable legislation, as set out in our Records Management Policy.

Online payments by credit or debit cards for some Services provided by the Library are processed under contract using specialist Data Processors. When a payment is processed by Data Processor acting on our behalf, card details are collected over a secure link and protected by industry standard software which encrypts your information. We do not collect any payment card account details and they are not made available to us.

Our service provider will use the information you provide to process your payment or to refund any monies due to you. Please refer to the terms and conditions for the relevant Service for further details. Payments processed on behalf of the Library are managed in line with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.

We may change this policy from time to time to reflect changes in the law and/or our privacy practices. We will update the date at the bottom of this page whenever we do that. We encourage you to check this policy for changes, for example when you revisit our websites. In the event of a major change to our policy we will contact you to inform you of the change.

By submitting your personal information to us, you are indicating that you understand how we use your personal information, as described in this policy.

If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer at:

When you engage with our Business & IP Centre (BIPC) we will collect information about your business (potentially including financial information), as well as your contact details, and certain other data required to meet equality monitoring requirements (which will include Sensitive Personal Information in relation to yourâ¯ ethnicity and gender).

We will use your personal information to provide you with the Services that you have requested from us, such as workshop bookings, attendance at events, advice sessions, and similar business support activities (e.g. in the performance of a contract with you). We will also use your contact information in order to supply you with relevant transactional documentation.

We may use your contact information to contact your business with information about our Services which we believe may be of interest to you. This is on the basis of our legitimate interests, as set out in the Privacy of Electronic Communication Regulations 2003 (as amended), which covers business to business email communications.

Many of the services that we offer through the BIPC are also available through our partner organisations in the British Library Business & IP Centre National Network. We may share your information with our partners in the Network as necessary to provide you with the services you have requested, and to carry out our legitimate interests in monitoring, auditing, and developing the services of the Network. Our Network partner organisations may also use your information for the same reasons.

The services that you have requested will be provided by a variety of third party consultants who will be experts in the relevant field. We will share your information with them for the purpose of providing the services, and they may also use your information to offer you further support outside of the Library's service provision.

We may use various organisations to provide IT capabilities in support of our Services, and who may process your information on our behalf. These Data Processors will process your information only under contract to the Library, and may not use your information in any other way. In particular, we use the following systems to process your information:

If you engage with a BIPC service we will retain your information for the current year plus a further six years after the date of your transaction in order to comply with tax and accounting rules.

The British Library uses CCTV, and other related technologies such as passive terahertz body scanners, on all of our physical sites for the purposes of safety and security management. We do this in the performance of our public task to protect the UK's national collection of its published output, and in order to protect the vital interests of our staff and visitors.

CCTV footage is retained for 31 days before being automatically overwritten, and security scan records are retained for 24 hrs, unless deliberately archived for evidential purposes in the event of a security incident.

Upon request, we will routinely provide copies of our CCTV records to the police in the performance of their legitimate duties.

Further information about our use of CCTV can be found in our CCTV Policy, which is available upon request.

The British Library collects the published output of Great Britain, and has over 150 million items in its Collections. Our Collections contain personal data in many forms; in newspapers, radio recordings, oral history interviews, modern literary archives, electoral rolls, and in our archival copy of the .uk web domain.

We collect, catalogue, and make available our Collections (and the personal data contained within them) as part of the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, e.g. as the national and legal deposit library of Great Britain. Further details about our public task can be found at the end of this page.

Where Sensitive Personal Data is found in our Collections it is processed for the purpose of archiving in the public interest. Where such data would be likely to cause substantial distress or harm to the data subject if disclosed it will be withheld from public access, but will still be retained in our Collections.

Personal data contained in our Collections will be retained in perpetuity, so as to inform the research of future generations.

Please note: If you use the personal data present in our Collections as part of your research then you become a Data Controller in relation to that data, and are responsible for using that data fairly, ethically, and in compliance with the law. In particular, personal data which is used for research purposes may not be used in order to make decisions about or take actions in relation to the data subject in question, and may not be used in ways which would cause substantial damage or distress to them.

In this section, please read all instances of âyouâ to include âyour child(ren)â in those cases where you provide us with information about minors who are in your care.

This is on the basis of our legitimate interests, as set out in the Privacy of Electronic Communication Regulations 2003 (as amended), which covers business to business email communications.

We may analyse information about your transactions to carry out our legitimate interests in monitoring, auditing, and developing our Learning & Education Services.

Please note that photography (both video and still) for publicity purposes is often undertaken at our events, either by us, by third party photographers acting on our behalf under contract, or by media organisations. Such photography will primarily be focussed on groups and activities rather than on individuals. If you have any objection to such photography please make this known to a member of staff at the event. If we wish to take individual photographs or video recordings that are specifically focussed on you then we will always ask for your specific consent at the time.

We may use various organisations to provide IT capabilities in support of our Services, and who may process your information on our behalf.

The British Library is required to generate a proportion of its income from commercial activity and philanthropic donations. As such we carry out fundraising research in order to understand the background of people who may support us, and to help us to make appropriate requests to supporters who may have the desire to donate to the British Library.

From time to time we may analyse our database to find people who we think might be able to support us based on factors such as previous contributions, transaction history and demographics. In doing so we may use profiling techniques or use third party wealth screening companies and insight companies to provide us with general information about our donors or potential donors. Such information is compiled using publicly available information, information that has already been provided to us through the use of our Services, or information shared by other organisations where they have been given consent to do so.

We will not send fundraising and development marketing to users of our Services unless you have specifically consented to receive marketing communications from us. We may however make direct funding applications and approaches to known philanthropic donors or other high profile supporters of the Library through their charities, foundations, agents, or private offices.

All of our fundraising and development activities are carried out on the basis that they are in the legitimate interests of the British Library, and that the personal data is processed in such a way that the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of our donors and potential donors are properly protected.

In our fundraising database we process personal information relating to the identity of our potential or actual donors, their family, employment history, social activities, interests, and financial status and philanthropic activities. In relation to our actual donors we also process their bank and GiftAid details in order to manage their donations.

General information about donors or potential donors is retained for as long as it remains current and of potential use, after which it is deleted. Transactional information about donations is retained for the year in which the donation was made plus a further six years for tax and accounting purposes.

We have chosen to register with the Fundraising Regulator and adhere to their Code of Fundraising Practice. We ensure that all our fundraisers and third parties do so. Information about our donors may be used to ensure that we comply with the Fundraising Regulator's Code of Fundraising Practice, which stipulates that we must take steps to assess and manage risks to our work and reputation with regard to certain levels of donation. More details can be found at www.fundraisingregulator.org.uk.

We may also use this data (and other data relating to your use of our Services such as audit trails) for the purpose of analysis in support of Service improvement, IT security, or other legitimate interests of the Library.

Online payments by credit or debit cards for some Services provided by the Library are processed under contract using specialist Data Processors, and in line with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.

We will also collect details about your ethnicity and any disability you may have; we have a legal obligation to ensure that equality and diversity obligations are being met in relation to access to our public Services.

As part of setting up your Reader account we will also check your proof of ID and proof of address as set out in our Reader Registration process. in certain rare cases me may ask you to join a video conference call before attending one of our sites in order to verify your identity. We will not take copies of the documents that you provide in order for us to confirm your ID.â¯ We will take a photograph of you for use on your Reader pass. As you use the Library we will also record your interactions with our Collections, such as your order history and audit trails of which electronic items you have accessed. Again, this is part of the performance of a task carried out in the public interest; the British Library has a statutory responsibility to protect the security of its Collections. Further details about our public task can be found here.

Details relating to the specific Collection Items that you have requested during your use of our Collections (for example through use of our Reading Rooms or our remote Services such as Document Supply) will never be used to provide marketing analysis or similar functions (for example, to send you personalised marketing material), but may be used on an aggregated and depersonalised basis for Service improvement purposes (for example, to determine whether we are purchasing enough journals in a specific foreign language to match our Readers' research interests).

Upon request we will routinely provide copies of our records to the police in the performance of their legitimate duties. However, in accordance with agreed international ethical standards for libraries, we will not provide details of the specific Collection Items that you have requested during your use of our Collections to any third party unless compelled to do so by law, with two exceptions:

We may use various organisations to provide IT capabilities in support of our Services, and who may process your information on our behalf.

Where we want to disclose your information to a third party, for example, to take up a reference or to carry out a background check for the purpose of pre-employment security vetting, we will not do so without informing you beforehand, unless the disclosure is required by law.

We may use various organisations to provide IT capabilities in support of our Services, and who may process your information on our behalf. These Data Processors will process your information only under contract to the Library, and may not use your information in any other way. In particular, we will use the following system to process your application:

Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed. It will then be securely destroyed or deleted.

This statement sets out the functions carried out by the British Library that are within the Library's public task under the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015 and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016.

The British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom and one of the greatest research libraries in the world. Established by Act of Parliament in 1972, the scope of its remit, the scale of its operations, the range of its services and the international importance of its collections are without equal. The collection - which consists of some 150 million items - is unconstrained by subject, geography, format or language.

The Library's public task comprises all the statutory functions, duties and responsibilities as defined in the relevant sections of the British Library Act 1972. The Act charges the British Library Board with:

For the avoidance of doubt, the British Library views all of its Collection management related activities as part of its Public Task, including the collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storing, adaptation, digitisation, facilitation of retrieval and consultation, disclosure by transmission or dissemination, and licensing of any or all material held by the British Library on behalf of the nation.

Under the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003, the British Library:

The British Library also undertakes the functions formerly assigned to the Registrar of Public Lending Right, under the Public Lending Right Act 1979, namely:

The Library's public task is also incorporated in our mission and vision and in our six public purposes.

Six public purposes encompass our scope and remit and provide a framework for why and how we spend the money the public entrusts us with:

These purposes are aligned to our statutory duties as set out in the British Library Act 1972, the Public Lending Right Act 1979, and the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 as amended by The Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013.

This statement of public task is reviewed every 5 years and is due to be considered again in 2025.

If you have any queries on our public task statement, please email FOI-Enquiries@bl.uk.

https://www.bl.uk/cyber-incident/,html_files\www_bl_uk_cyber_incident_.html,"We're continuing to experience disruption as a result of a cyber-attack that took place in October 2023. The outage is still affecting our website, online systems and services, as well as some onsite services, however our buildings are open as usual.

The attack caused substantial damage that is complex and challenging to repair, beginning with the installation of a completely new computing infrastructure for the entire Library.

As the new academic year begins we are restoring a number of services. Our CEO, Sir Roly Keating, explains more in a new blog.

Our teams have been working since the cyber-attack to find ways to restore access to as much of our collection as possible, but disruption to certain services is expected to persist for some time. Find out more about the impact on our research services.

We have published a paper about the attack and its impact, introduced in this blog by our Chief Executive. Its goal is to share our understanding of what happened and to help others learn from our experience.

In November the attackers released some of our data onto the dark web including some personal user information. We've contacted our users to alert them to this incident and to offer advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on how to protect themselves, including updating their passwords on other systems.

If you have any questions relating to your data you can email our Data Protection Officer at data.governance@bl.uk.

Because our systems were badly damaged during the cyber-attack they remain unavailable, so you can't change the password for our services. However, if you use the same password for non-British Library services, we recommend that you change it as a precaution.

The NCSC offers advice on staying secure online, including how to create a strong password, as well as specific guidance for individuals who may have been impacted by a data breach.

We're really sorry for the ongoing disruption to our systems and services and we'll provide further updates when we can. Thank you for bearing with us.

Please send your request to customer@bl.uk. However, please note that we may not be able to identify exactly what information was compromised given the nature of the attack and we might not be able to action these requests at the moment, but will attempt to do so when we again have access to our systems.

Because our systems remain unavailable, you won't be able to change the password you have previously used to access British Library services. However, if you use the same password, or one similar, to access other, non-British Library services, we recommend that you change it as a precaution.

If you have not already done so you should take this action immediately. The NCSC provides guidance on staying safe online, as well as specific guidance for individuals who may have been impacted by a data breach.

The assessment of the damage and the replacement of our systems is a significant challenge and will continue for some time. You can find out more about the impact on our research services here.

Our buildings in London and Yorkshire are open as usual, but our services are limited. You can use our Reading Rooms and public areas for personal study but there is limited access to collection items. You can find out more about how to use our research services here.

Our exhibitions and events are all going ahead as planned, and our Treasures Gallery, shops, cafes and restaurants in London are open as usual.

Get the latest information about accessing our collection here.

Please email customer@bl.uk and we'll come back to you as soon as we can.

Please email customer@bl.uk (08.30 - 16.30 Monday to Friday).

We'll get back to you as quickly as we can but are currently experiencing a high volume of enquiries so it may take us some time to respond.

Online ordering is not currently possible, so you will need to come to the Reading Rooms to order your collection items. Please contact our Reference Services Team before you visit to check what you need will be available, by contacting us.

The online catalogue is a searchable version of our main catalogue of books and other printed material.  It contains records relating to the following collection item categories:

To order an item you'll need to place a manual order in one of our Reading Rooms by completing a paper order form. Our staff can help you with this.

To identify the items you need, you can use our online catalogue to search for the item you require. If a record is marked âNot availableâ, this means the item is unavailable at the moment. If a record is marked âShould be availableâ, you will be able to see a shelfmark reference. You can take note of the shelfmark, because you will need it to place a manual order in the Reading Rooms by completing a paper order form.

We canât guarantee that items marked âShould be availableâ are available to order; they may be in use by another Reader or restricted for other reasons. To check the availability before you visit, contact our Reference Services team by contacting us.

In the Reading Rooms you can also consult our printed catalogues, which contain items not currently included in the online catalogue.

Find out how to register for PLR and whether you are eligible.

If you have contributed to a book which is available to be lent out by public libraries in the UK and the Republic of Ireland you can register for UK and Irish PLR schemes.

Eligible book contributors can register online for both the UK and Irish PLR schemes.

You will be guided through the process of creating an account (if you donât already have one) and setting up your PLR profile. This process includes verifying your identity.

Alternatively, contact us if you would like an offline account.

To be eligible for PLR you must meet the following criteria:

For both UK and Irish PLR you should register each book and each new edition where it has a different ISBN. New editions include paperbacks, large print, audiobooks and eBooks. Once an ISBN has been registered once you do not need to apply for it again each year.

Audiobooks and eBooks do not qualify for Irish PLR

A book is eligible for PLR registration:

Material that is not eligible for PLR registration:

Find out how to calculate the share you are eligible for.

Printed bookTo qualify for PLR in a printed book you should be named on the title page or be entitled to a royalty payment from the publisher. When two or more contributors are involved, they must divide the PLR between them. This is done on the basis of percentage shares (see below for further details).

Only contributors who are named on the title page of a book and have contributed to the text or illustrations inside the book qualify for registration. Writers of a foreword or short introduction do not qualify if this was their only contribution. Publishers and packagers are not eligible for PLR.

To register printed books you do not have to own the copyright. Prior to including non-print material in the PLR scheme, audio and eBook lending was covered under copyright law. If you have signed over the licensing rights in your audio/eBook to your publisher, you may still register for UK PLR unless the publisher is already charging the library a licence fee to lend out your audio/eBook. PLR is not aware of such licence fees, but we are required to ask you to confirm that, to the best of your knowledge, a licence fee is not payable.

AudiobookFor PLR purposes, although an audiobook can come in a variety of forms, it is only eligible if it would read like a book should the entire content of the recording be printed. In order to be eligible for PLR, an audiobook must:

The following audio materials do not qualify for registration:

E-books and e-audiobookEligibility for eBooks is the same as for print books and eligibility for e-audiobooks is the same as for audiobooks.

Please note, eBooks and eAudiobooks do not qualify for registration with the Irish PLR scheme.

If you use a pseudonym you should apply for PLR using your real/legal name. When registering for PLR the ID used for verification must match the name on our records.

You will be able to provide your pseudonym when you register your books, and we will link your registered name and pseudonym on our records.

When registering online for PLR you will be asked to carry out an online ID verification check. There is an option to skip this stage and complete the ID checks at a later date. Although you will be able to submit your books, they will not be registered to qualify for payments until ID verification has been completed.

This IDV will be carried out using a trusted 3rd party verification service called Yoti. As part of this process you can either upload a picture of your identity document or use a webcam or in-built camera to take a photo.

If you do not wish to use online identity verification you can contact us to discuss the available options.

Where a co-contributor has died or cannot be located, the remaining contributor(s) may still register a share that reflects their contribution. If similar books have been registered in the past, the same share agreement may stand.

If you are unable to contact the other contributors, you may only apply for a share which you feel reflects your contribution to the book. However, if the other contributors subsequently apply for different shares, we may remove your share until an agreement is reached. If there are other contributors named on the title page who are deceased, not eligible for PLR or do not wish to register, you should still allocate a notional share to reflect their contribution.

It is not possible for someone else to apply on your behalf (e.g. agent, publisher, partner), unless they are acting under a Power of Attorney, in which case we would need to see a copy of the legal documentation.

The UK PLR office only administers the UK and Irish PLR schemes. However, UK and Irish authors are eligible for payments from the PLR systems operating in a number of other European countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Austria. These payments are administered by ALCS.

Eligible illustrators, photographers and visual artists can apply to claim their share of Dutch PLR payments through the Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS). Further information is available from DACS

Find out more about international PLR schemes.

For both UK and Irish PLR, payments are made annually based on book loans data collected from public libraries over a 12-month period.

In the UK the PLR year runs from 1 July to 30 June. To qualify for payment for loans during this period authors must register their books by the closing date of 30 June. The Irish PLR year runs 1 January to 31 December. Books must be registered by the following 30 June to qualify for payment for loans during this period. Neither PLR scheme allows for retrospective payments to be made for earlier years.

To register for the UK PLR scheme, you must have your only home or principal home in the UK, or in any of the other countries within the European Economic Area (i.e. EC Member States and Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) at the time of registration.

Under the provisions of the PLR legislation authors resident in UK overseas territories and Crown dependencies such as the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and Gibraltar are not eligible to apply for PLR registration.

If you have more than one home, your principal home is the one where you spent most time during the 24 months before your application. Continuous residence after registration is not a requirement, however if you move outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA) after registration you may not be able to register any new titles or editions for PLR. Once a book has been registered it will remain on the PLR system and you will continue to receive a statement each year.

To register for the Irish PLR scheme, you may be a resident or citizen of any of the countries within the EEA or UK. If you are not an EEA resident and are applying for Irish PLR as a citizen, you will be asked to confirm your citizenship within the EEA and may be required to provide proof.

Please note that it is not possible to register for UK PLR as an EEA Citizen if you do not live within the EEA or UK. The UK PLR scheme takes no account of nationality but requires applicants to be resident within the UK or EEA to qualify for registration.

If you renounce your PLR rights, you are requesting to remove some or all of your registered titles from the register. This means that you will no longer receive any loans information or payments on the renounced books.

You may renounce books which have been assigned to you (i.e. the rights have been transferred to you on the death of the original registered owner or assigned as a gift). In order to renounce you should contact us.

Renouncing your PLR rights does not affect any future applications to register for PLR. You may therefore re-register at a later date after you have renounced your rights.

PLR is a property right, which may be given away, sold or bequeathed. You are able transfer PLR interests to a new owner (either an individual or organisation) who will become the PLR assignee. Please note that by assigning PLR, you are permanently giving up your right to receive earnings and information on the loans of the books. It is possible to assign different books to more than one assignee. A separate assignment form will need to be completed for each assignee, specifying which titles are to be assigned to them. However, it is not possible to divide the PLR in one book between different assignees.

You may wish to nominate an alternative payee (such as a friend or family member or a chosen charity) to receive your PLR earnings. This does not change the ownership of the Public Lending Right. You can amend your payment arrangement at any time via your online account. If you wish to assign your PLR rights to somebody else, please contact us.

For both the UK and Irish PLR schemes, the right to receive PLR continues for up to 70 years after the date of the original registered ownerâs death. These rights can be transferred via assignment to a third party to reflect the wishes of the registered owner, as expressed in their will.

Please contact us to advise us of a registered ownerâs death and the PLR team will help to guide you through this process. The legal representative of the estate will be required to complete an Application for Assignment (Transfer on Death) form. In order to transfer the PLR, we will need to see copies of either the will and Death Certificate or Grant of Probate, Letters of Administration or Confirmation document. These documents will be returned once we have recorded receipt. If no documentation is available, the Next of Kin should provide a letter to confirm this.

First applications to be registered for PLR may not be made by the estate of a deceased author. However, if the deceased had registered books for PLR during their lifetime, under certain circumstances, additional books may be registered by the executor (or the new owner if the PLR rights have been assigned).

Posthumous applications to register new titles can only be accepted if the book was published within one year before, or up to 10 years after the date of the original registered ownerâs death.

New editions of existing registered titles can be added at any time during the life of PLR (up to 70 years after the date of the original registered ownerâs death). You must register separately each book and each new edition where it has a different ISBN. However, once an ISBN has been registered you need not apply for it again. If you wish to make a posthumous application, please contact us and we will guide you through this.

Due to legal requirements to protect confidentiality, we are not permitted to discuss a registered ownerâs affairs with anyone other than the registered owner identified on our records. This policy applies unless we have received official documentation (such as Power of Attorney) which allows a nominated individual to act on their behalf. You are responsible for the administration and security of your account, and you should not share your password.

For security purposes we can only accept changes of address or payment details via the following methods of correspondence:

For both UK and Irish PLR you will need to calculate your contributor share when registering your books for PLR. Find out more about how to calculate the share of PLR earnings youâre entitled to for your work.

Typically a sole contributor is the only person named on the title page of a book and no other person has contributed. If you are the sole contributor of a book you are entitled to 100% of any PLR payment.

If there are two or more contributors any PLR payment will be based on the percentage share that reflects your contribution. Percentage shares should be agreed between all eligible contributors before you register the book for PLR. Each contributor should submit their own separate application.

Share agreements can be made either verbally or in writing (this includes emails). The percentage split should reflect individual contributions to a book, and the figures should be whole numbers (e.g. not 33.3%).

If you are unable to contact the other contributors, you may only apply for a share which you feel reflects your contribution to the book. However, if the other contributors subsequently apply for different shares we may remove your share until an agreement is reached.

If there are other contributors named on the title page who are deceased, not eligible for PLR or do not wish to register, you should allocate a notional share to reflect their contribution.

Your share should reflect your contribution (even if paid by fee). If you are the author of a book with illustrations you should agree appropriate shares with the illustrator(s).

A Translatorâs share is fixed at 30% (if you are named on the title page or elsewhere in the book).

Your share should reflect your contribution. Basic share is 20% but joint editors/compilers should choose a share from the guidelines below and divide this equally between co-editors.

20% share â if, in addition to normal editorial work, you have written more than 10% of the book or 10 pages of text and you are named on the title page. If you are not named on the title page you may still register 20% if you have a royalty agreement with the publisher, regardless of whether you have contributed 10 pages or 10% of the book.

50% share â if you have compiled the book from diverse material involving substantial rearrangement, editing, transcribing, and/or abridgement plus some explanatory writing.

80% share â in exceptional circumstances, for example, where it has taken many years of research to produce a book from obscure primary material and there is a large amount of original writing by the editor or compiler.

100% share â if you have written the entire book (even if you are only credited on the title page as editor or compiler).

80% of the text share (after the illustrator's share has been allocated) where the original author is named on the title page or 100% of the text share where no original author is named.

Your share should reflect your contribution. If you are a ghost writer whose name does not appear on the title page you are not eligible for PLR unless you have a royalty agreement with the publisher or an agreement with the author named on the title page. The subject or interviewee may be regarded as a co-author if they had a significant part in producing the book, apart from giving interviews, such as checking manuscripts, making revisions etc.

Audiobook shares are calculated differently to reflect and remunerate narrator and producer contributions. If your audiobook contribution is both as the writer and narrator, you can claim for both shares (i.e. 60% + 20% = 80%). If there are multiple writers, the writerâs share allocation should be split between all writers. If there are multiple narrators, the narratorâs proportion should be shared between all narrators. See example calculation below.

*The audiobook abridger and/or translatorâs share is deducted from the writerâs share. An abridgerâs 12% is deducted as 20% from the writerâs share and a translatorâs 18% share is deducted as 30% from the writerâs share.

**The producer is defined as âthe person who organised the performanceâ not the publishing company who employed the producer.

Please note that audiobook titles are not currently eligible for PLR under the Irish scheme.

Under the UK PLR scheme your audiobook âpackâ is separated into 50% for the book element and 50% for the audio element. When registering your pack titles you should apply agreed book shares to 50% and agreed audiobook shares for the remaining 50%. See the example calculation below:

Under the Irish PLR scheme, you may only register a share for the 50% book element as audio material does not qualify. See the example calculation below.

Find out how we calculate your payments and how much you can earn if you register with PLR.

Both UK and Irish PLR Schemes are Government funded. After the deduction of administrative costs, the PLR fund is divided by the total loans of registered books to arrive at an annual 'rate per loan' figure, which is reviewed annually.

This forms the basis for calculating payments, which are made to authors and other eligible contributors whose registered titles have recorded sufficient loans from UK and Irish public libraries. UK payments are based on a sample of library loans data, whilst for Irish payments, loans data is collected from all public library authorities in the Republic of Ireland.

Under the UK PLR scheme there is a minimum payment threshold of Â£1 and a maximum of Â£6,600. The rate per loan for PLR year 2022/23 loans was 13.69p. The table below shows the UK PLR payments made to registered applicants for the 2022/23 year:

For Irish payments the minimum threshold is â¬2 and the maximum is â¬1000. The rate per loan for PLR year 2022 for Irish payments was 7.02 cents.

Annual statements confirming how much you will receive are issued for Irish PLR in November and UK PLR in January. Irish payments are made in December and UK payments in February.

If you have an online account or an offline account with an email address you will be emailed a link to your statement. If you have an offline account, we do not hold an email address for you and you have earned received a payment you will receive a postal statement.

You can be paid directly into your bank or building society account or via a collecting society for EEA residents. Collecting societies exist in most countries and collect fees arising from remuneration rights for authors (e.g. PLR and photocopying rights). An author who is a member of one of the collecting societies below can choose to have their PLR payments sent via the society:

CEDRO has an arrangement to pay reduced tax and at present Pictoright, DILIA and SIAE do not have a tax exemption in place. All other collecting societies mentioned below can make payments exempt of tax as they have a block tax exemption in place. If you are a member of one of the collecting societies listed and you are willing to receive payment via this method, please insert the name of the appropriate collecting society when applying.

We will contact the society to verify your membership and arrange for payments to be collected on your behalf. Please note that collecting society payments can take up to four weeks. If you have still not received your payment after four weeks please contact us.

We can also make direct credit payments to accounts held in Euros and accounts in Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. For countries in the EU with their own currency (i.e. Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Romania and Sweden) we will send payment in Euros. However, please note that if the account is not a Euro account your bank may charge you to convert the payment.

You may wish to nominate an alternative payee (such as a friend or family member or a chosen charity) to receive your PLR earnings.

This does not change the ownership of the Public Lending Right. You can amend your payment arrangement at any time via your online account. If you authorise us to send your PLR earnings to an alternative payee, we have no liability for the payment once it is successfully made to the nominated account (Section .49 PLR Scheme 1982; Schedule 4 refers).

It is your responsibility to keep your contact and bank details up-to-date. If we make a payment to your nominated account and the payment is returned to us, we will inform you and place the payment on hold until we receive new payment instructions. You can check and update your payment details online or by calling us on +44 (0)7827 985578 or +44 (0)7936 600761.

After six years from the payment date, if we have not received valid payment details, your entitlement to the payment will lapse and the money will go back into the fund for re-distribution.

We currently have over Â£100,000 in unpaid PLR earnings. If you are registered for PLR and have not heard from us in recent years we may have outstanding earnings for you to claim.

UK PLR payments to UK residents are made without tax deductions. Payment details should be declared as income in your tax return. For non-UK residents, payments are subject to tax at the basic rate, under Section 536 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Tax exemption can be applied for by contacting HM Revenue & Customs Centre for Non-Residents Double Taxation Treaty Team (tel: 0300 200 3300 from the UK; + 44 135 535 9022 from overseas). Further information and forms can be found on their website

If you have income from a source in one country and are resident in another, you may be liable to pay tax in both countries under their tax laws. To avoid 'double taxation' in this situation, the UK has negotiated Double Taxation (DT) treaties with more than 100 countries.Irish PLR payments are made without deduction of tax regardless of your country of residence. Any queries relating to tax and Irish PLR payments should be addressed to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.

PLR is outside the scope of VAT in both the UK and Ireland and should not be declared on VAT return forms. This is because PLR is a statutory activity and makes no taxable supplies. A PLR payment is not a royalty as the author is receiving a share of a subsidy or grant. In cases of any difficulty in relation to the UK scheme your local VAT offices should be asked to refer to VAT Administration Directorate (VAH2) quoting reference TL1158/82.

Recent changes to PLR legislation will enable PLR to move from collecting loans data from a sample of UK public libraries to collecting national loans data from all UK public libraries over the next few years. Until then PLR figures will continue to be based on loans data collected from a sample of UK public libraries 1 July â 30 June every year.

A grossing-up calculation is applied at the end of the PLR reporting year in order to provide a national estimate of loans per ISBN.

UK Public Lending Right (PLR) is a legal right to payment from Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport funding for eligible book contributors when their books are borrowed from public libraries.

The UK PLR scheme is administered by the British Library from its offices in Boston Spa. The UK PLR office also provides registration for the Irish PLR scheme on behalf of Public Lending Remuneration, Ireland.

For the current spending review period, PLR funding amounts to Â£6.6 million per year. Contributor payments, capped at Â£6,600 pa, are based on loans data collected from a sample of public libraries in the UK. The Irish Public Lending Remuneration (PLR) system covers all libraries in the Republic of Ireland and operates in a similar way.

British authors campaigned for 30 years for the recognition of their right to receive payment for the free loan of their books through the public library system.

In the 1970s the campaign gained momentum with the emergence of the Writers Action Group (WAG). Addressing fears that the government might make PLR a charge on library users, and, therefore, threaten the principle of free public access to libraries, the WAG campaign focused on the need for a centrally-funded scheme.

PLR was established by the Public Lending Right Act 1979 which gave British authors a legal right to receive payment for the free loan of their books by public libraries. The Act established PLR as an intellectual property right, entirely separate from copyright

The principles of PLR were set out in the 1979 primary legislation and a 1982 Scheme provided more detailed rules for the operation of UK PLR, such as which authors and books are eligible, how many libraries should be included in the sample and how the amount payable should be calculated.

The Public Lending Right Act 1979 and subsequent Public Lending Right Scheme 1982 were amended by the Public Bodies (Abolition of the Registrar of Public Lending Right) Order 2013. Responsibility for the administration of the PLR scheme transferred to the British Library in October 2013.

The Committee provides advice to the PLR Management Team and the British Library Board on the operation of the UK PLR Scheme. The Committee consists of an independent Chair and six members representing PLR's key stakeholder groups.

A further two vacancies on the committee are currently being advertised.

The following form can be requested in other languages, large print, and braille from the PLR office. Please contact us for further information or if you need a form that isnât available here.

And you can trust our expert conservators to take as much care with your collection as we did with Magna Carta.

Our location photography service meant that the precious 600-year-old Bible could be digitised without leaving its home in Malmesbury Abbey. The stunning images faithfully reproduce the colours and gold leaf of the pages, while revealing decoration that wouldnât be possible to see with the naked eye.

We digitised over 750,000 items from the Royal Society of Chemistryâs archives, so that they could share their collections with their members and new audiences around the world. This included scanning of over 1,000 glass lantern slides using our specialist equipment.

We worked with the University of Warwick to convert more than 1,000 doctoral theses from microfilm to digital with our state-of-the-art microfilm scanner. This project opened up valuable research to new generations of researchers, so that they could learn from previous studies and push their own work further.

Inspired by the British Libraryâs sound archive, the exhibition explores the people, spaces and genres that have transformed the landscape of British music.

Traversing musical genres, from classical, gospel and jazz through to reggae, jungle and afroswing, Beyond the Bassline charts the influence of Black British musicians, creatives and entrepreneurs on popular music since the 16th-century. It also considers the role emerging technologies and the internet have played in creating, listening to and sharing music.

The exhibition spotlights the spaces â physical, digital and symbolic â that have cultivated creative expression and inspired a number of Black British music genres, from The Reno in Manchester, Bristolâs Bamboo Club, Scottish club night The Reggae Klub and The Four Aces in London, to carnivals, community centres and record shops across the country.

Encompassing more than 200 exhibits, Beyond the Bassline features:

To accompany Beyond the Bassline there will be a rich programme of public events, including live performances, club takeovers by No Signal (26 April), Touching Bass (3 May and 12 July) and Queer Bruk (21 June), as well as in conversation events with eminent singer-songwriters Eddy Grant (26 April) and Joan Armatrading (18 June), with more to be revealed.

Visitors to Beyond the Bassline will also get to see a new, specially commissioned film. iwoyi: within the echo (2024) is a five-channel 10-minute film and sound installation exploring the radical potential of Black British music to manifest reparative futures. Directed by Tayo Rapoport and Rohan Ayinde in collaboration with the South London-based musical movement and curatorial platform Touching Bass, the film is produced by NOIR and has an original score made by Melo-Zed.

New soundscapes, artworks and films exploring Black British identity through the medium of music feature throughout the exhibition and have been created by community-rooted, youth-led group Jukebox Collective, charitable enterprise and network Rastafari Movement UK Wellbeing, bespoke loudspeaker system Friendly Pressure and literary activist, theatre maker and published writer, Khadijah Ibrahiim.

Curated by Dr Aleema Gray at the British Library in collaboration with Mykaell Riley at the University of Westminster, Beyond the Bassline follows a three-year partnership to research, foreground and reposition six centuries of African musical contributions to the UK.

Dr Aleema Gray, lead curator of Beyond the Bassline at the British Library, said: âThe exhibition represents a timely opportunity to broaden our understanding of Black British music and situate it within a historical conversation. Black British music is more than a soundtrack. It has formed part of an expansive cultural industry that transformed British culture.â

Associate Professor Mykaell Riley, guest curator of Beyond the Bassline at the British Library and Director of The Black Music Research Unit at the University of Westminster, said: âThis is British history, this is popular music. And the exhibition is not an end point but the beginning of a new positioning of Black British music, within academic research and high art spaces.â

There will be panel displays and events at public libraries across the UK, arranged through the Living Knowledge Network, with each libraryâs collection, regional connections and local music scene at the core, to help tell a national story about Black music in Britain.

Beyond the Bassline tickets are on general sale from today (beyondthebassline.seetickets.com/) and cost Â£15 with concessions available. There will be Pay What You Can days on the first Wednesday of every month.

We offer highly attractive practice-based courses which are independently rated as excellent, many with international recognition.

Our commitment to educating graduates for the needs of professional life attracts high quality students from within the UK and around the globe.

Global engagement, employability and sustainability are key elements in the University of Westminsterâs vision for the future and we strive to ensure the very highest standards are met and maintained.

Would your child benefit from some extra help with their reading?

Could you spare an hour a week to help a child improve their literacy skills?

The Read to Succeed scheme, run by Artizan Street and Barbican Children's Library, offers children aged five to 14 years the opportunity to improve their literacy skills and develop a love of reading for life by pairing a child with a volunteer reading partner.

If you can spare an hour a week to help a child develop their reading skills by giving one to one support and encouragement with the aid of full training, or you would like your child to improve their reading, contact Barbican Children's Library.

DonationsIf you would like to sponsor our programmes for adults and children, please consider making a donation to our libraries. 100% of all monies received from donations comes to the Barbican and Community Libraries service.

The Women's Art Library began as the Women Artists Slide Library, an artists' initiative that developed into an arts organization publishing catalogues and books as well as a magazine from early 1983 to 2002.

WAL collected slides, ephemera and other art documentation from artists and actively documented exhibitions and historical collections to offer a public space to view and experience women's art.

Thousands of artists from around the world are represented in some form in this collection.

As part of Goldsmiths Library Special Collections and Archives, the Women's Art Library continues to collect slides, artist statements, exhibition ephemera, catalogues, and press material in addition to audio and videotapes, photographs and digital media.

We welcome donations from women artists to help us develop this collection, which contributes to the curriculum and programming that facilitates new research and art projects, notably through the Women’s Art Library/Feminist Review Art in the Archive Bursary.

Any donations should be accompanied by forms you can download from Artists' Documentation.

The Women's Art Library is located in the Library's Special Collections and Archives on the ground floor.

The SCA study space has audiovisual equipment for group use, a photocopier and a sliding table.

Independent researchers, as well as students and staff, are welcome to consult the collection.

The Women's Art Library collection is catalogued in the Library catalogue and the Archive and Textile Catalogue.

Please phone Special Collections 020 7717 2295 or email special.collections (@gold.ac.uk) to make an appointment or visit for further information about access and related collections.

A travelling archive

The WAL App provides information about the Women’s Art Library and features women artists from the Library’s archive – see their art, read about their work and listen to their 'in conversation' audio recordings. A special 'participate' feature allows you to help bring more attention to the Women’s Art Library – its archive and the WAL App – by making and posting your own 'art slide' on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

The App is part of a project called How to Make an Archive Travel? led by Dr. Ana-Maria Herman and is funded by the Women’s Art Library, Goldsmiths' Research Development Funds (CIG) and Goldsmiths' Public Engagement Grants.

Download the WAL app.For more information about this project visit the How to Make an Archive Travel blog. Twitter: @archivetravels

The artist Monica Ross has been a key figure from the earliest days of the Women Artists Slide Library.  Her groundbreaking collaborations with Kate Walker and Su Richardson in Fenix and Feministo: The Women's Postal Art Event form some of the most consulted documentation in the Women’s Art Library collection. The passionate commitment to feminism that drives this early practice continued to develop into the uncompromising art practice through which she responded to urgent social issues and connected her audience. She went on to embrace the power of performance and this culminated in the monumental Acts of Memory (2008-2013). But before this work, on the 24th of March 2000, Monica performed a script written in response to an invitation to speak on Art, Activism and Feminism in the 1970s. It was at a conference titled “347 Minutes – Live in Your Head: Ideas and Experiment in Britain, 1965–75” that Monica performed ‘history or not’, and the document seen here was especially created by her for the Women's Art Library. At last we reciprocate her tribute to the WASL and commemorate this extraordinary artist.

http://www.gold.ac.uk/make/publications/,html_files\www_gold_ac_uk_make_publications_.html,"A number of publications were produced by the Women's Art Library (MAKE) in addition to the magazine.

Editors: X Marks the Spot, Joan Anim-Addo, Althea Greenan, 2015softback, colour and b/w illustrationsISBN 978-1-902770-15-4

Download XMTSHumanEndeavour (pdf)

Editors: Maria Walsh and Mo Throp London : I.B. Tauris, 2015softback, b/w illustrationsISBN 9781780767581

Editor Fran Lloyd, 1999  258 pp softback, colour and b/w illustrations  ISBN 1-86064-599-2  £15.95

This publication is a first for the UK, inspired by the exhibition of Arab women's art, Dialogue of the Present which toured in 1998/99. The book is an anthology of essays challenging preconceptions about the pre-eminence of western art and exploring issues affecting women artists working across the Arab diaspora.

The exhibition's curator, Siumee Keelan explains the exhibition's inspirations and origins, while Salwa Nashashibi, curator of the only other major exhibition of Arab women's art (Forces of Change, Washington DC 1994), writes of support systems in art practice. Tina Sherwell considers the role of the body in contemporary arab women's art from Shirin Neshat to Ghada Amer. The exhibition drew together a vastly diverse range of artwork ranging from calligraphy to body-casting which the editor Fran Lloyd considers in her own essay contemplating the wider cross-cultural dialogues and identities signaled by this work.

The book also includes colour and black and white illustrations plus biographical information on the following artists: Firyal Al-Adhamy, Malika Agueznay, Jananne Al-Ani, Thuraya Al-Baqsami, Rima Farah, Maysaloun Faraj, Batool Al-Fekaiki, Saadeh George, Mai Goussoub, Wafaa El Houdaybi, Kamala Ibrahim Ishaq, Leila Kubba Kawash, Sabiha Khemir, Najat Maki, Houria Niati, Azza Al-Qasimi, Zineb Sedira, Laila Al-Shawa.

Edited by Angela Dimitrakaki, Pam Skelton and Mare Tralla, 2000 122 pp, softback, colour and b/w illustrations ISBN 1-86064-655-7 £14.95

This collection of specially commissioned writings was also inspired by an exhibition of women's art, the British-Estonian show titled Private Views. The essays expand on many key issues raised by the artists' work which spans Eastern and Western Europe exploring tradition and technology, feminism and postfeminism, and national discourses and the market.

The international list of contributors brings an inter-disciplinary perspective to this latest publication looking at contemporary art from the point of art history, geography, social history, education and cultural studies. The artists and writers featured are: Susan Brind, Angela Dimitrakaki, Naomi Dines, F.F.F.F., Marit Folstad, Anu Juurak, Eve Kiiler, Katrin Kivimaa, KIWA, Mari Koort, Pauline van Mourik Broekman, Aoife Mac Namara, Barbi Pilvre, Ene-Liis Semper, Joanne P. Sharp, Liina Siib, S.Girls, Pam Skelton, Tiziana Terranova, Annika Tonts, Mare Tralla, Sonja Zelic.

Both of these publications are available for purchase from IB Tauris."

The library contains published and unpublished written documentation, photographs, posters and videos in addition to a substantial slide collection and artists' files on contemporary and historical women artists. The artists' files contain paper documentation, photographs and slides, postcards, photographs, press cuttings and ephemera, with much of the material donated by women artists. Early feminist art journals held include Feminist Artists Newsletter (UK), Heresies (USA) and Matriart (Canada).

There is also a complete run of the MAKE serial publication titled The Women Artists' Slide Library Newsletter, The Women Artists' Slide Library Journal, Women's Art Magazine and Make, the magazine of women's art.

One of the most important sections of the collection is the Women of Colour Index (1985-1995) which was developed in collaboration with the African-Asian Visual Artists Archive. This includes information on individual Black women artists working in the UK as well as key exhibitions that took place during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Archives of key arts organisations and arts events include the Women's International Art Club (1901-1978) and the International Festival of Women Artists (Copenhagen 1980, Nairobi 1985) as well as important individuals such as Dame Laura Knight (1877-1970), Pauline Boty (1938-1966) and Jo Spence (1934-1992).

The Women's Art Library began as an artists' initiative and continued to run a membership scheme for women artists for 20 years. The scheme encouraged women artists to document their work and deposit slides and any other information to form a unique resource.

Individuals and groups came to see these files as dedicated spaces for their work in a public setting. The documentation typically included slides, CV, a written statement, exhibition information, catalogues, invitations and press reviews. However the Women's Art Library also collected audio and videotapes, CD-Roms, books and photographs.

Women artists continue to donate unique material today. Goldsmiths, University of London is eager to maintain the active development of the Women's Art Library (MAKE) special collection with the same commitment as its donor, MAKE, the organisation of women in the arts.

All types of documentation - from the digital to the handwritten artist statement - are welcomed as the collection is as interested in the myriad forms of art documentation as the artist herself. 

There are two downloadable forms which should accompany what you send.

If Women’s Art Library - Make is approached for permission to reproduce your work we would always contact you as the artist and copyright holder. This is why we need to have your most up to date or reliable contact details.  

The Women’s Art Library – Make is open to independent researchers as well as academics and students and we certainly welcome visits from artists, so please do not hesitate to get in touch if you would like to make use of these resources.

Content focussed on historical and contemporary women's art practice and highlighted emerging and established artists from around the world. In addition to reviews and previews, content was made up of artists' projects, interviews and featured debates.

First published in 1983 as a newsletter for the Women Artists Slide Library, it was developed throughout the 1980s and early 1990s as a Journal and then Women's Art Magazine.

From a modest A3 document this publication culminated in a full colour 100 page final issue in 2002. The provocative stance of the magazine was established by a diverse range of editors ensuring its unique position amongst international arts publications."

http://www.iranianlibrary.org.uk/,html_files\www_iranianlibrary_org_uk_.html,"The Iranian Library is situated in Acton, in West London and is the library of the Iranian community in the United Kingdom.

Although, in the main, these are Persian and other Iranian language publications, the library has also a growing collection of foreign language books and publications on Iran. For those people interested in academic research, particularly in Iran's contemporary history, the library's archives, which contain a wealth of political and cultural publications, documents, reports and statistical information, provide an invaluable service. Also kept in the archives are a number of old and rare publications which students and researchers are unlikely to find elsewhere.

 The library is a lending library. Members can borrow four books for a period of four weeks.

The Library is open to every Iranian and non-Iranian Persian speaking individual who has a genuine need to use its collections. 

The library also organises regular lectures on various topics including Persian literature, histoy, medicine and science. 

Other important activities include Saturday Persian School and Painting lessons. The Persian School offers Persian courses up to GCSE level. 

The library’s opening hours are: 

                11.00 AM – 17.30 PM

The library is closed during Iranian New Year and summer holiday.

The collection includes numerous papers relating to the Victorian church architects Henry Woodyer (1816-96) and Frederick Preedy (1820-98), Victorian stained-glass artists and a number of Victorian architects. It also includes an extensive collection of papers, newspaper cuttings, photographs and plans relating to churches in the London area.

Gordon Lansdown Barnes (c.1917-85) was an ecclesiologist, a local historian and an architectural photographer with a national reputation. Much of his photographic work can be found in the National Monuments Record (Historic England Archive).His published works include Stepney Churches (1967), and Frederick Preedy, Architect and Glass-Painter 1820-1898 (1984). He also worked with Canon Basil Clarke on ‘Demolished and Desecrated Churches of London’.

Correspondence and diaries of the Rt Revd George Bell (1883-1958), successively student of Christ Church, chaplain to Archbishop Randall Davidson, Dean of Canterbury, and from 1929 Bishop of Chichester.

This extensive collection includes material on the German churches before and after the Second World War, the allies’ war policy, relief work among refugees, the atomic bomb, the ecumenical movement and Churches overseas, South Africa, religious drama and art, liturgy, and church and state relations.

William John Birkbeck (1859-1916) was a theologian and liturgical scholar concerned with relations between the Church of England and the Russian Orthodox Church. He travelled extensively through Russia exploring its history and culture. In 1895 he was involved in Viscount Halifax’s ecumenical mission to Rome. In the same year, he published Russia and the English Church, consisting of the correspondence between the Rev. William Palmer, an Anglican divine, and Alexis Stepanovich Khomyakov, a Russian layman and theologian.

The collection comprises family papers and correspondence, diaries, study and lecture notes and covers Birkbeck’s work on Church history, theology and liturgy, his involvement in the Anglo-Catholic movement and ecumenism.

The basis for the BCC’s existence was the same as that agreed in 1938 for the proposed World Council of Churches – “A fellowship of churches which accept Our Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour.”The functions of the BCC were defined as follows:a) To carry on the work of its three predecessor bodies.b) To facilitate common action by the churches in evangelistic enterprise, in promotion of international friendship, in stimulating a sense of social responsibility and in guiding the activities of the churches for the welfare of youth.c) To promote co-operation in study and to ensure adequate British participation in the studies promoted by the World Council of Churches.d) To assist the growth of ecumenical consciousness in the members of all churches and generally to promote Christian unity.

The BCC began with sixteen member denominations including the Church of England, Baptist Union, the Methodist Church, Church of Scotland, Salvation Army, The Society of Friends; and several inter-denominational organisations including YMCA and YWCA.

The Catholic Church had no involvement with this body. In the 1980s a dialogue began between the two which became known as the “Not Strangers but Pilgrims Inter-Church Process”. The intention was to be able to bring the two together. As a result of this process the BCC ceased to exist on 31 August 1990 to be replaced the following day by a new ecumenical body the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland (of which the Catholic Church was a part). In 1999 this new body was renamed to become known as Churches Together for Britain & Ireland.

The Christian Faith Society originated in 1691 in a bequest of Robert Boyle for advancing ‘religion among infidels’, and was renamed in 1794 the Society for the Conversion and Religious Education of the Negro Slaves in the British West-India Islands and in 1836 the Society for Advancing the Christian Faith in the British West-India Islands.

The papers comprise minutes, correspondence and accounts, 1642-1956.

A micropublication of the Christian Faith Society is available from World Microfilms. 

Selected images from the collection are available here.

The Church Defence Institution formed in 1859 with the aim of defending the Church of England against attacks from Nonconformists (chiefly the Liberation Society) and various Acts of Parliament such as the Welsh Disestablishment Bill, Church Rates Reform and the Burials Bill. The CDI intended to fight against these incursions by promoting the establishment of local branches of the Church Defence Institution, producing leaflets, lectures, and publications to promote the history, established position in society, and endowments of the Church.

Its archive contains Minute Books, Agenda Books, Reports from Sub-Committees, Annual Receipts and Expenditure (finance), and various correspondence and papers relating to the Church Defence Institution (also known as the (Central) Church Committee for Defence and Instruction).

The original Church Reform League was inaugurated in 1895. Its main principle was that “church reform should be carried out by the Church herself through her own assemblies.” The members also, in varying degree, advocated an extended role for the laity in Church government and administration; Diocesan Trusts to administer endowments and appointments to livings; and that the clergy should hold office only “during the adequate performance of duties”.

The Church Society was founded in 1950 by the merger of the Church Association (f.1865) and the National Protestant League (f.1906), which was itself an amalgamation of the National Protestant Church Union (f.1893) and the Church of England League (f.1904), formerly the Ladies League (f.1899).The collection comprises minutes of the Church Association and its committees from 1867, and the National Protestant Church League, 1919-49.

The English Church Union was founded in 1860 by the merger of the Church of England Protection Society (f.1859) with a number of local church societies with the similar object of defending and propagating high church principles. In 1934 the ECU united with the Anglo-Catholic Congress to form the Church Union.

The collection comprises minutes of the ECU and CU, Anglo-Catholic Congresses, Bristol Church Union, and parochial returns on reservation, 1954.

Basil Fulford Lowther Clarke (1908-78) came of an Anglican clerical family, was ordained in 1932 and after several curacies served for thirty years as vicar of Knowl Hill, Berkshire, in the Diocese of Oxford. He was the brother of cryptologist Joan Clarke (1917-96) best known for her work as a codebreaker at Bletchley Park during World War II.

From the age of fifteen in 1923, encouraged by his father who was secretary of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, until the end of his life Clarke kept manuscript notes on the numerous churches which he visited. By the time of his death 55 years later he had filled 31 notebooks with information on 11,479 Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in England, with occasional excursions abroad. This means that his notes cover about two-thirds of the churches of those two denominations in England.The collection contains written and typed notes, correspondence, newspaper cuttings, manuscripts, guide books, photographs and postcards.Part of Cathedral and Church Buildings Department library and archive until its transfer to Church of England Record Centre in 2016.

Records of ecclesiastical administration during the Commonwealth period, including parochial surveys, and surveys of the former episcopal and capitular estates, records of appointment of clergy and augmentation of benefices. Originally numbered in the manuscript sequence as MS 902-22, 944-50, 966-1021, these were renumbered in the 1960s as a separate collection.

A micropublication of the Commonwealth Records is available from World Microfilms.Further information is available in the online catalogue descriptions, partly based on: Houston, J. Catalogue of Ecclesiastical Records of the Commonwealth 1643-1660 in the Lambeth Palace Library (1968).

Selected images from the collection are available here.

The records of the Community of St Andrew cover its 19th- and 20th-century history and include minutes, correspondence, photographs and other material. The Library also holds printed material relating to the community. The collection documents the wider history of the deaconess movement and the role of women in the church as well as the community’s own work.

Some documents from the archive were published in Henrietta Blackmore, The Beginning of Women’s Ministry: The Revival of the Deaconess in the 19th Century Church of England (2007).

For additional information on deaconesses, please see the attachment below.: 

The Oxford and Edinburgh Conferences of 1937-1938 led to calls for the setting-up of a World Council of Churches (WCC) and the subsequent founding of a Council on the Christian Faith and Common Life (CCFCL) in 1938.

In 1942 CCFCL amalgamated with the Commission of the Churches for International Friendship and Social Responsibility (CCIFSR) to form a single body, namely the British Council of Churches (BCC).

Includes records generated by the Council’s foundation and also its financial and operational activities. Also includes Council’s committee meeting papers.

The Corporation of Church House collection contains materials relating to the formation and operation of the Corporation of Church House between 1798 and 2003. The collection contains written and typed notes, correspondence, newspaper cuttings, reports, minute books, deeds and leases, photographic materials, books and articles.

The Corporation of Church House was founded as the Church of England’s permanent tribute to Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. The man who developed the idea, Dr Harvey Goodwin (Bishop of Carlisle), saw it as the national administrative headquarters and likened it to a “chapter-house for the Church of England”. Land was quickly acquired in Dean’s Yard, close to the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey, but the existing tenancies meant that only a fraction of the original design could be built in the early 1890s. The original gothic-style buildings were demolished in the 1930s and replaced with the current Church House in 1937. During World War II Church House survived a bombing and was requisitioned by Parliament to serve as an alternative location for both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

In 1939 the British Christian Council for International Friendship, Life and Work (BCCIFLW) and the [English] Christian Social Council (CSC) amalgamated to form the CCIFSR.

In 1942 the CCIFSR and the Council on Christian Faith and Common Life (CCFCL) amalgamated to form a single body, namely the British Council of Churches (BCC).Its archive includes records generated by the Commission’s foundation and its operational activities. Also includes meeting papers.

Photographic collection of images of church architecture (external and internal) in Sussex and Kent.

A collection of the papers and correspondence of William Croome. Croome had a lifelong interest in the care and conservation of church buildings. As churchwarden, altar server and sacristan at North Cerney Church he was a key figure in the life of the church and the maintenance of the fabric and interior of the building. He served on various diocesan advisory committees and in 1950 took on the role of Vice-Chairman of the Central Council of the Diocesan Advisory Committees. He served on the Wall Paintings Committee of the Council for the Care of Churches (CCC), was the Vice-Chair of the CCC, and the Chairman of the Cathedrals Advisory Committee.

Doctors’ Commons, the association or college of ecclesiastical lawyers founded in 1511 and situated in Knightrider Street, London, was dissolved following the Court of Probate Act, 1857.

Its records were dispersed, but most of those that survive are in the Library. These comprise the register, 1511-1855, a 19th century minute book, and financial and estate papers.  For further details and a calendar of the register of Doctors’ Commons (DC 1), see G.D. Squibb, Doctors’ Commons. A history of the College of advocates and doctors of law. (1977).

Selected images from the collection are available here.

Correspondence of Canon J.A. Douglas, vicar of St. Luke, Camberwell, and from 1933 Hon. General Secretary of the Church of England Council on Foreign Relations, concerning relations between the Church of England and the Eastern Orthodox Churches during the first half of the 20th century.

Gerald Alexander Ellison (1910-92) was Bishop of London and a highly respected and influential figure in the Church of England. He was the spokesman for all church legislative matters in the House of Lords and developed the area system in London.

The collection includes official and personal papers from his time as Bishop of Chester (1955-76), Bishop of London (1973-81) and his service in the House of Lords. Official papers cover the wide range of his activities and include correspondence, administrative files, papers on foreign visits and official diaries. Personal papers include family and private correspondence, personal diaries, papers relating to his education and photographs.

The Library holds the official papers of several Bishops of London, known as the Fulham Papers as they were were transferred from Fulham Palace, the former Bishops’ residence.

The majority of the collection dates from the 18th-19th centuries and includes correspondence on the administration of the diocese of London, and on the churches, particularly in America and the West Indies, which came under the bishop’s jurisdiction at the time.

It also includes a series of visitation returns, 1763-1900, the earlier volumes being at London Metropolitan Archives alongside other records of the diocese (ref: DL).

A micropublication of the colonial sections of the papers is available in several American libraries and may also be purchased from World Microfilms, who also published micropublications of the letterbooks of Bishop Blomfield and the London visitation returns 1763-1815.

For the diocese of London see also the Building on History project.

Extent of the Diocese of LondonThe boundaries of the diocese of London were changed a number of times during the 19th century. Until 1845, the diocese included most of the parishes in Middesex, Essex, the city of London parishes (excluding the thirteen parishes in the peculiar of the Arches), a substantial number of parishes in Hertfordshire, and the four parishes of Aston Abbots, Grandborough, Little Horwood, and Winslow in Buckinghamshire.

The abolition of the exempt jurisdictions in 1845 brought into the diocese of London the parishes in the city of London and some parishes in Middlesex and Surrey which were formerly peculiars of the archbishop. At the same time the diocese gained various Kent parishes just south of the Thames (Charlton, Deptford, Eltham, Greenwich, Lee, Lewisham, Plumstead, and Woolwich) and retained nine Essex parishes just north of the river (Barking, Chingford, East and West Ham, Little Ilford, Low Leyton, Wanthamstow, Wanstead, and Woodford).

The remainder of Essex was temporarily transferred to the see of Rochester. London also lost its parishes in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Under the London Diocese Act of 1863 and the Diocese of St. Albans Act of 1875, provisions were made for the future removal of the Essex, Kent and Surrey parishes from the diocese of London. In 1877 the diocese of London was confined to the county of Middlesex, including the cities of London and Middlesex.

Selected images from the collection are available here.

Seven notebooks with notes and drawings relating to church architecture. Many of the entries are undated, but the notes apparently date from the late 19th or early 20th century.

The records of the Incorporated Church Building Society (ICBS) comprise the minute books and some 16,000 files relating to applications for grants for the building and restoration of churches thoughout England and Wales, from the foundation of the Society in 1818 until 1982. Applications were made on a standard form which included data on the population and character of the parish, as well as information on the church building.

Catalogue data includes information on the churches, reasons for the grants, and the names of surveyors, architects or other professionals responsible for the buildings, and indicates the existence of plans and photographs. For further information on the ICBS archive and how to use it visit our Library Catalogues page. 

Also of use is “List of I.C.B.S. grants, 1818-1927” (from The Incorporated Church Building Society annual report for … 1927).

Selected images from the collection are available here.

Correspondence and papers of the Revd. John Keble and various relatives, including Thomas Keble (1793-1875), vicar of Bisley.

Copy of 48 sermons preached between 1672 and 1689. They are attributed to John Kettlewell (1653-1695), but the authorship is uncertain.

This collection is on deposit and the Library is unable to provide copies in any form. 

The collection comprises the personal papers of Marjorie Milne. The bulk of the collection is made up of personal notebooks, diaries and writings dating from the late 1950s through to the 1970s. Most of the material focuses around Milne’s devotional thoughts and plans for Christian unity through the Trinity centres.

The Rt Revd Hugh Montefiore was born into a prominent Jewish family. He converted to Christianity whilst at school and became Bishop of Kingston upon Thames (1970-78) and Bishop of Birmingham (1978-87). He wrote many books and was a sometimes controversial, but influential, figure.  

This collection comprises official papers (records spanning Bishop Montefiore’s career in the Church of England and including correspondence, sermons and records of Montefiore’s involvement with charities and social activism) and personal and family papers (personal papers of the Bishop and his wife, including records of Montefiore’s service in the armed forces during the Second World War, diaries, passports, photographs, and research compiled by Montefiore’s biographer John Peart Binns).

Records created by the headquarters of the Mothers’ Union (MU), Mary Sumner House, Westminster. Founded to promote the sanctity of marriage and Christian family life, the MU was primarily interested in the morality of society, and its activity ranged from petitioning parliament to running family fun days. By the early 20th century, the MU had established itself in dioceses overseas, undertaking a mix of missionary and development work.The archive comprises minutes, correspondence, accounts, pamphlets, architectural plans, photographs and slides. The majority of the archive dates from the 1890s onwards, as it was not until then that the Mothers’ Union established a centralised structure. The papers also contain a few series of documents originating from members who, although not always based at Mary Sumner House, played important roles within the organisation.

For a summary guide to badges within the MU archive, please see the attachment below: 

This collection comprises designs and photographs of completed works by church furnishers A.R. Mowbray and Company Limited; brochures and catalogues of church furnishing companies including A.R. Mowbray, and material relating to the Warham Guild prior to its merger with Wippell Mowbray Church Furnishing Limited.

In 1977, the BCC Assembly by a narrow vote commended this to the churches. The initiative which had now become known as a Nationwide Initiative in Evangelism (NIE) was to stimulate rather than organise local evangelism, to cover all four nations, and apparently also fitted in with the Methodist world-wide call to evangelism, which was happening at that time.

This archive contains the papers of the NIE and these include files relating to the various predecessor influences which led up to its foundation, the minutes of its committees and working parties, and papers relating to the 1980 Assembly. There are also correspondence files with the counties and London boroughs as well as the denominations and organisations involved with the NIE.

The Parish and People movement was founded in 1949 as a British response to the ‘Liturgical Movement’ which influenced many denominations in continental Europe, popularising the parish communion as the main worship event at parochial level.

The Parish and People movement also promoted grassroots growth in team ministry, synodical government and church unity and its range of publications encouraged new thinking and practice in liturgy, collaborative ministry and training. It therefore represents an important reformist strand in the history of the 20th-century Church.

The Queen Victoria Clergy Fund was formed to raise support and funds both from diocesan bodies and the laity to augment the incomes of poor clergy, similar to the efforts made by Queen Anne’s Bounty (founded in 1704) and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (founded in 1836) and emerged directly from two lay organisations dedicated to ameliorating clerical hardship – the Tithe Redemption Trust (or Fund) in 1846 and the Church of England Incumbents’ Sustentation Fund in 1873 – both of which were ultimately absorbed into the Queen Victoria Clergy Fund (in 1899 and 1897 respectively).The QVCF was set up with the intention of 1) impressing upon the entire church the need to contribute to the support of the clergy; 2) supplementing and extending the diocesan organisation for the support of the clergy; and 3) generally promoting the sustentation of the clergy.

Correspondence and papers of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline, which was appointed in 1904 and reported in 1906: Report of the Royal Commission on Discipline, together with Minutes of evidence taken before the Royal Commission.

The papers comprise 25 volumes, including minute books, surveys of churches where ritualist practices had been introduced, 1901-5, and newspaper cuttings, 1904-6.

Correspondence and papers of SPG, comprising the papers of John Chamberlayne, first secretary of SPG, 1702-11, later given to the Archbishop of Canterbury, minutes, 1701-50, financial records, 1702-96, and some late 18th century correspondence of the Archbishops of Canterbury relating to the church overseas and the establishment of episcopacy in America.

For other correspondence, 1702-14, see the Tenison volume in Archbishops Papers and for minutes of SPG, 1758-66, see MS 1124 within the manuscripts series.

Micropublication of the SPG Papers is available in a number of American Libraries and may be purchased from World Microfilms.

Further information is available in the online catalogue descriptions, based on:Manross, W.W. S.P.G. Papers in the Lambeth Palace Library. Calendar and Indexes (Oxford, 1974).

The main historic archives of SPG are held at the Bodleian Library. These include series A, B and C. 

The Society was instituted in 1788 for the relief of country clergy, ‘the tenor of whose preaching is according to the doctrinal articles of the Church of England’. The records comprise minute books and registers, 1788-1864.

The SSF is an international Franciscan religious order. It was formed in the 1930s by uniting groups in the Franciscan tradition including the Brotherhood of St Francis of Assisi. The Society originated in the work of the Reverend Douglas Downes during the depression following the First World War. Brother Douglas and his associates travelled the roads, sharing the life of itinerant men and boys seeking work. In 1921, a landowner offered a Dorset farm as a base for the work, which became Hilfield Friary. Father Algy Robertson was also an important figure in the formation of the Society.

There are three different orders within the Society: the First Order of brothers and sisters (The Society of St Francis and The Community of St Francis respectively), the Second Order of sisters (The Community of St Clare) and the Third Order of lay men and women. The Library’s SSF collection covers the wide range of activities of the First Order of brothers, including constitution and admission documentation, communication and correspondence between UK and overseas-based missions, personal papers of the brothers and minutes of council and chapter meetings. The collection also includes items from the Brotherhood of the Love of Christ, which joined the Society in 1937, and the Society of the Servants of Christ, a Christian ashram founded in India.

Founded in Oxford in 1866, the Society of Saint John the Evangelist (SSJE) became the first male Anglican religious order of men founded since the Reformation. The Founder, Richard Meux Benson, took vows of poverty, obedience and celibacy and, along with Simeon Wilberforce O’Neill and Charles Chapman Grafton, began a Society which would continue in Britain for almost 150 years.

Missionary work, both at home and overseas, was a fundamental aim of the Society and by the turn of the 20th century missions had been established in Bombay and Poona in India and Cape Town in South Africa. Work would also begin in America in 1870, and this would be followed in 1928 with a house opening in Ontario, Canada. At home, a church, mission house and schools were built in the Cowley district of Oxford, and in 1905 a purpose-built London home for the Society was established at Great College Street, Westminster. In 2011 the British Chapter of the Society came to an end, though an American Chapter based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, still thrives.

The SSJE collection provides a record of all the activities of the Fathers, including missionary work, conducting retreats and delivering sermons and addresses. The overseas missionary work is particularly well recorded within the Fathers’ personal papers, with large quantities of letters from India and South Africa surviving to provide a vivid recollection of the early days of the Society in what were often harsh, uncompromising conditions. Also included are copies of the Rule and Statues by which the Fathers lived their lives, a range of minute books documenting the administration of the Society, a large number of photographs which feature various Fathers, the Society’s properties at home and abroad, the types of missionary work undertaken by the Fathers, and records which detail the establishing of the Society’s London House.

St. Gabriel’s College was founded by Canon Charles Edward Brooke [1847-1911] in consultation with Miss Matilda Ellen Bishop [1844-1913], to whom he had been introduced in 1898 by Dr. Randall Davidson, then Bishop of Winchester.  The College was unusual in having a woman principal, for Church training colleges had previously been headed by clergymen. Another notable feature of the College was its admission of Free Church candidates as day students, exempt from Anglican religious instruction.

Records include papers on the College government and administration, papers of the founder, principals and staff, records relating to academic activities as well as the College’s closure.

Correspondence, travel diaries, photographs and files relating to the life and work of John Stott (1921-2011), the rector of All Souls, Langham Place (1950-75), Chaplain to the Queen (1959-91), and prominent evangelical leader. Stott was also the author of around fifty books, including ‘Issues Facing Christians Today’ and the series entitled ‘The Bible Speaks Today’, primarily written at his rural retreat on the Pembrokeshire coast.

This collection includes material relating to key evangelical conferences, such as the 1974 International Congress of World Evangelism at Lausanne, at which Stott was the Chair of the Drafting Committee of the Lausanne Covenant; as well as the minutes and reports from organisations which John Stott was instrumental in founding, such as Langham Partnership International, the London Institute of Contemporary Christianity, the Church of England Evangelical Council, the Evangelical Fellowship in the Anglican Communion and the Eclectics Society.

Thirteen albums and a binder with notes and drawings ‘From my font collection – queries and queerities’. Comprising black and white photographs of fonts with captions and a box with index cards with notes on fonts. Also includes card index with additional notes.

The Institute was founded in 1843 at a meeting of Church of England Sunday school teachers at St Saviour’s Southwark. At this meeting it was resolved “That an Institution be formed to be called the Church of England Sunday School Teachers Institute” for the purpose of increasing the means of communication between Sunday School Teachers by establishing lectures and conversational meetings, together with a library & reading room. The Institute set out to provide a specifically Anglican element to the Sunday School movement because it was felt that in Church Sunday Schools the catechism should be taught and the prayer book used. It became an Incorporated Society in 1903.

Scrapbook created 1923-29 by J.G. Taylor, church architecture historian. Includes images of church architecture taken from newspapers, parish magazines, pamphlets and guides. Includes pencilled place index on a separate sheet.

The Lord Wharton Charity was founded in 1692 by Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton, for the purchase of bibles, catechisms and other books for poor children in Buckinghamshire, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Yorkshire.  The collection includes accounts, minutes and papers, mainly 19th-20th century.

Photographs of misericords carvings with index.

WAIF was founded in 1914. It amalgamated with the Christian Social Council of Great Britain and Ireland in 1935 to form the British Christian Council for International Friendship, Life and Work (BCCIFLW). The archive includes the Alliance’s meeting papers, reports, financial and operational records. Also includes photographs.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/about-lambeth-palace-library/our-building/,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_about_lambeth_palace_library_our_building_.html,"Lambeth Palace Library, founded in 1610 and one of the earliest public libraries in the UK, has a purpose-built home for the first time, designed by Wright & Wright Architects. Completed in 2020, the new Library is a sensitive addition to the site of the Grade I listed Palace and is the first new building on the site for 185 years. The façade is designed in homage to the Tudor gate tower of the Palace and blends into the red brick perimeter wall of the gardens. Nestling amongst mature trees at the north end of the garden, the location preserves the collection’s historic link to the Palace, while increasing public access to the Library.

Facilities for readers and the public have been improved greatly. The new reading room accommodates twice as many readers as the old one and there is a dedicated readers’ lounge with kitchen facilities. The Library also includes group working areas and seminar rooms, plus the Bancroft Room and roof terrace, which delivers flexible event/lecture space with seating for up to 70 people. The new entrance hall is open to the public and contains interactive displays and exhibits from the collections.

Care for our internationally important collections is at the heart of the design. The new building replaces inadequate facilities in a warehouse in Bermondsey and cramped accommodation in thirteen separate rooms within Lambeth Palace, many of which lacked fire suppression and were difficult to control environmentally. By contrast, all stores in the new Library are temperature and humidity controlled and have fire suppression systems. As the Palace is on one of London’s many flood plains, the archive repositories are located above any potential flood risk. The building frame is designed so that the archive stores are as airtight as possible, and all air is filtered to prevent pollution damaging the books and archives. As the collections are continually growing, significant growth space has been included.

Lambeth Palace gardens are listed and are the oldest continuously cultivated gardens in London, dating from the twelfth century. The Library is designed to minimise the building’s impact on the grounds and to enhance the local ecology of the gardens. The new building takes up less than 3% of the area of the site and acts as a bulwark between the garden and Lambeth Palace Road, significantly reducing noise and air pollution in the garden. There is a new and enlarged pond and wetland glade and the area around the Library has been designed by award-winning landscape architect Dan Pearson Studio. All public spaces and the reading room benefit from carefully attuned natural light and have views across the enhanced gardens.

Care has been taken to make the building as sustainable as possible and it has achieved a BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) rating of ‘Excellent’. BREEAM is the world’s longest established method of assessing, rating, and certifying the sustainability of buildings. 

The building is highly insulated and designed to minimise the amount of energy needed to keep the internal environment stable. Furthermore, on-site renewable energy provided by photovoltaic panels makes up almost half of the electricity that the building uses. The building has also been designed to reduce water use by at least 25%, by using water efficient toilets and hand basins. The pond harvests the run-off water from the rooftops and acts to attenuate and filter water through planting within the pond, before it enters the public drainage system at a slower rate. The Library is close to public transport links, is designed to support walking and cycling, and will add no new parking (except blue badge parking).

… a subtle, rewarding building and landscape, acknowledging its workaday function while enriching it as a place of study and of huge cultural and historical value.

… a heavenly new home for Lambeth Palace Library.

a curious but compelling building …

The Archbishops’ Papers are the official papers of the Archbishop of Canterbury. They are wide-ranging, covering political and social issues as well as ecclesiastical history in Great Britain and more generally throughout the Anglican Communion. Apart from correspondence they may include diaries, sermons, newspaper cuttings, and reports on ordinands. The Archbishops’ papers mainly date from the mid 19th century onwards and are generally subject to a thirty-year closure rule.

Aside from the surviving papers of individual Archbishops listed below, there may also be material relating to specific Archbishops in other collections; for this, search for the relevant Archbishop in the name authority database.

For further information about the Archbishops, please see our research guides and the finding aid below: 

Descriptions of different Archbishops’ papers in the online catalogue vary in detail. Papers of 19th-century Archbishops were indexed in greater detail than those of 20th century Archbishops, and in particular the papers of Archbishops Davidson, Lang and Fisher were catalogued in less detail. 

Note that papers of some Archbishops may be held elsewhere; for guidance, see the National Archives catalogue. The Dictionary of National Biography (available online by subscription and in many public libraries) also contains useful information. 

Selected images from the collection are available here.

From 1279 to 1642, the registers are the principal record of the Archbishop’s administration. After the Restoration the registers were superseded in importance by the Archbishops’ Act Books, part of the Vicar General archive.

The registers include institutions and appointments of clergy, grants of dispensations, ordinations, appointments of bishops, sede vacante administration of suffragan sees, diocesan and metropolitical visitations by the archbishop, visitation of monasteries, records of convocation, and heresy trials.

There are a large number of published finding aids to Archbishops’ Registers in the link below:

A micropublication of the Archbishops’ Registers, 1279-1640, is available from World Microfilms Publications. This also includes the cartulary of the see of Canterbury (MS 1212). 

Selected images from the collection are available here.

Minute books of the Bishops’ Meetings, a gathering of diocesan and suffragan bishops in England and Wales, chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and held biannually from 1871.

The Carte Miscellanee or Lambeth Charters date from the 12th century onwards, and include royal charters relating to archiepiscopal estates, patents of appointment of officials, bonds from recusants, returns of diocesan clergy made for Archbishops Grindal in 1576 and Whitgift in 1591, records relating to the London tithes dispute, 1634-9, to the Great Plague and Fire, 1665-6, and to the abbey of St Benet of Holme, Norfolk.The collection was brought together and numbered as MSS. 889-901 in the early 18th century, but was disbound and renumbered as CM I-XX in the early 1960s.

The series has been continued with the addition of archiepiscopal records, the East Kent deeds of the Langleys and Peytons of Knowlton relating to Knowlton and Sandown, and various acquisitions from the late 12th century to the 20th century. These include a late 13th century roll of Augustinian statutes, 16th century deeds for various monasteries, including St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, Christ Church, Canterbury, and Southwark priory, libri cleri for the diocese of Norwich, sede vacante, 1499, and for the diocese of Canterbury, 1610, professions of obedience to Archbishop Warham, 1504-23, and acta of Archbishop Warham, 1507-12.Further information is available in the online catalogue descriptions, based on:Owen, D.M. A Catalogue of Lambeth Manuscripts 889 to 901 (Carte Antique et Miscellanee) (1968).Carte Antique et Miscellanee: Supplementary Series (CM 23-55): a Catalogue.Churchill, I.J. East Kent Records. A Calendar of Some Unpublished Documents and Court Rolls in the Library of Lambeth Palace (Kent Records, vol. 7, 1922). [Now CM 31-36]

Convocation is the ancient legislative assembly for the province of Canterbury, which since the 15th century met as two houses, the upper house of bishops, presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the lower house (of clergy) who elect their own chairman.

From its prorogation in 1717 until its revival in 1852, Convocation conducted no business whatever, its meetings being purely formal. The records comprise act books of the upper and lower houses, and committee papers mainly from 1865 onwards. Earlier records of Convocation were often recorded in the medieval archbishops’ registers and were printed in David Wilkins’ Concilia (1737). See also Gerald Bray’s published series on records of Convocation, covering from 1313 until its revival; then from 1858, proceedings of Convocation were published in The Chronicle of Convocation.

Parallel records for the York Convocation are held at the Borthwick Institute. 

The Council on Foreign Relations originated in resolutions passed by the Church Assembly in 1927 and 1932. Its terms of reference were the “survey and promotion of the Relations of the Church of England with Foreign Churches”, that is Churches outside the Anglican Communion, and its inaugural meeting  was held on 2 February 1933 with Archbishop Lang in the chair. From 1959 until 1964 its remit was enlarged to include ecumenical relations within Great Britain, such as relations with the Church of Scotland, during which time it was known as the Church of England Council on Inter-Church Relations. The Council was the church’s official organ for dealing with overseas churches until the creation, in 1970, of the General Synod with its Board for Mission and Unity. It was reconstituted as the Archbishop of Canterbury’ s Counsellors on Foreign Relations on 1 January 1972 and its work was finally wound up in 1981 when Archbishop Runcie brought ecumenical relations within the administrative structures and staffing of Lambeth Palace.

The Council functioned through a central committee and separate committees dealing with each of the churches: the Ancient Oriental, Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed, and Old Catholic Churches, all of which reported ultimately to the Archbishop of Canterbury through the Chairman and Secretary. Chairmen have included A.G. Headlam, Bishop of Gloucester, and George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, and CFR’s first Secretary was Canon John Douglas. The Headlam, Bell and Douglas Papers are all held in the Library.

The CFR papers are extensive and wide-ranging. Each committee produced minutes and series of numbered information documents for internal circulation, as well as subject files arranged by country dealing with ecumenical visits, ecumenical dialogues and exchange programmes for foreign clergy. Although they deal mainly with ecclesiastical relations they also have rich political content, especially for wartime Europe, the British Mandate in Iraq, and relations with Communist Eastern Europe. The files also deal with high-level relations with the Papacy and the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and there is detailed coverage of, for example, the Second Vatican Council.

The Court of Arches is the court of appeal of the Archbishop of Canterbury and dates back to the 13th century. However, with the exception of a small quantity of pre-Restoration material, the very extensive archive dates from 1660 onwards. In its heyday the court exercised an extensive jurisdiction over marriage, probate and testamentary disputes, defamation, church property (rates, tithes, fabric of churches), and morals of the clergy and laity. For further context, see the collection summary.

The collection includes over 2000 process books, transcripts of proceedings in the lower court sent up on appeal, and exhibits, including medieval title deeds (Fineshade cartulary), court books, probate accounts, churchwardens’ accounts, rate books etc.

Further information is available in: Houston, J. (ed.) Index of Cases in the Records of the Court of Arches at Lambeth Palace Library 1660-1913 (Index Library, vol. 85, 1972). This information and additional descriptions are also available in the online catalogue.

See also a list of documents in the Arches E series newly catalogued in 2017 via the link below: 

Several series of Court of Arches records were published in microformat by Chadwyck-Healey Ltd. and copies are available to consult in the Library.

The process books (series D) are also available from the British Library.

Parallel series of records were created by the Province of York courts. 

Selected images from the collection are available here.

The Faculty Office was set up under Peter’s Pence Act of November 1533 to issue ‘licences, dispensations, faculties, compositions, and rescripts, etc.’ previously granted by the pope or papal curia.

With the exception of three muniment books or registers, the archive dates from 1660 and comprises records of the grant of a variety of dispensations throughout England and Wales, including dispensations to hold benefices in plurality, marriage licences, appointment of public notaries in the British Isles and colonies, and the conferment of Lambeth degrees (W. Stubbs, ‘Lambeth degrees’, The Gentleman’s Magazine, 1864, Vol 216, pp.633-8, 770-2 lists degrees granted to 1848. For degrees 1848-1948, see MS. 1715, pp. 89-113). Also included are a few medical licences, and dispensations for ordination.

Selected images from the collection are available here.

The papers of the Lambeth Conference, which met first in 1867 and roughly every ten years thereafter, comprise verbatim accounts of the proceedings, committee minutes, correspondence and photographs.

The subjects covered by the Conferences were wide-ranging, spanning social and political issues as well as matters of ecclesiastical and theological significance throughout the world (see the published reports and resolutions, and Davidson, R.T. (ed.), The Six Lambeth Conferences, 1867-1920, 1929).

Selected images from the collection are available here.

A miscellaneous collection of material on the history of the Library, including obsolete catalogues, ranging from the earliest, which provides a catalogue of the books and manuscripts of the Library’s founder, Archbishop Bancroft, in 1612 and includes an account of the Library’s foundation (LR F/1), to those of previous Librarians (Paul Colomiès, David Wilkins, A.C. Ducarel, S.R. Maitland and S.W. Kershaw).Also included are letter-books of Claude Jenkins, Lambeth Librarian, correspondence, mainly 20th century, a few visitors’ books, and annual reports.

See also the Research Guides below: 

Selected images from the collection are available here.

A collection of papal bulls and rescripts, some of which were addressed to the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the majority of which relate to monastic houses, which came to Lambeth following the dissolution of the monasteries. The collection was arranged by A.C. Ducarel in the 18th century and bound up as MSS. 643-4. In 1960, the collection was disbound and numbered.

A micropublication of the papal bulls is available from World Microfilms in “Lambeth Palace Library: the medieval manuscripts” section II (Law MSS.), reel 18.

Further information is available in the online catalogue descriptions, based on:Sayers, J.E. Original Papal Documents in the Lambeth Palace Library. A Catalogue (Bulletin of I.H.R., special supplement no. 6, 1967). 

Records of the administration of the estates of the Archbishops of Canterbury situated principally in Kent, Surrey and Middlesex, but including property in Buckinghamshire, Lancashire, and Sussex. These include accounts, court rolls, leases, maps, plans, rentals, surveys and valuations, correspondence and related papers.

The composition of the temporalities was extensively changed by the Henrician exchanges whereby Archbishop Cranmer received a number of the former monastic estates in Kent and Lancashire in exchange for some of his more valuable properties in Kent and Surrey (see F.R.H. Du Boulay, The Lordship of Canterbury, 1966).

Further information is available in the online catalogue descriptions, partly based on:Sayers, J.E. Estate Documents at Lambeth Palace Library. A Short Catalogue (1965). Includes court and account rolls for a few religious houses, including Christ Church, Canterbury, and the convent of St. Benet of Hulme, Norfolk, and for medieval bishops of Bath and Wells, Chichester, and Winchester.

Selected images from the collection are available here.

The records of the Vicar General of the Archbishop of Canterbury relate to the ecclesiastical administration of the province, diocese and peculiars of Canterbury, mainly from 1660.The collection includes the Archbishops’ Act Books, which supersede the Archbishops’ Registers as the principal record of archiepiscopal administration from 1663. They provide the link between the two major aspects of his metropolitical and primatial jurisdiction exercised through the Vicar General and the Faculty Office.The Act Books record the appointments of bishops, the institution of clergy in the diocese of Canterbury, sede vacante appointments of clergy throughout the province of Canterbury, licences to officiate, to practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery, dispensations to clergy to hold in plurality, and appointments of proctors and advocates of the Court of Arches.

However, sections of the archive relating to the province of Canterbury, the Archbishops’ jurisdiction over the province of York and overseas church, and the Archbishops’ role as Visitor are not fully catalogued. With the exception of the subscription books, diocesan surveys, and visitation returns, and a small collection of visitation act books, 1540-1640, most of the purely diocesan records are held by Kent Archives.

For information on the extent of the diocese of Canterbury and the peculiar jurisdiction of the Archbishops, see the Library research guide on the the diocese.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/collections/printed-books/,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_collections_printed_books_.html,"The Lambeth Palace Library collections (excluding the Sion College collection, periodicals and prints) contain some 120,000 books and 40,000 pamphlets, relating in the main, but not exclusively, to the history of the Church of England and its relations with other Churches in Great Britain and overseas.

The core of the collection of early printed books was bequeathed by the Library’s founder, Archbishop Bancroft, in 1610 and includes books belonging to some of his predecessors, namely Cranmer, Grindal and Whitgift.

The collections have been enlarged by gifts from successive archbishops, especially Abbot, Sheldon, Tenison, Secker, and Davidson, and by a judicious policy of purchase by recent librarians, often with the help of the Friends of Lambeth Palace Library. The collections have also expanded by individual donations, the acquisition of external libraries and collections, such as that of the Dutch Church, and material from other Church of England collections such as the Cathedral and Church Buildings Library, the Commissioners’ Library, Church House Library and the Church of England Records Centre, which itself acquired several other collections over the years. 

As well as antiquarian material, Lambeth Palace Library continues to collect current scholarship relating to the history and administration of the Church of England (pre- and post-Reformation), or providing necessary background sources for research in this field. It also collects material supporting, or stemming from, the study of the historic collection of archives, manuscripts and early printed books in the care of the Library.

The library catalogue can be searched here.

Currently, Lambeth Palace Library actively collects more than 120 periodicals and serials, but also holds several hundred other historic periodical titles. These primarily focus on the Church of England and its relations with other Churches, covering topics such as liturgy, church history, and ecclesiastical art and architecture.

Hard copies of the most recent issues of forty selected periodicals are available to browse in the Reading Room, together with the following, which are available there in their entirety:

Other periodicals, and older issues of the forty selected, can be requested.

The Library has a collection of over 5,000 prints most of which are catalogued online. Particular strengths include views of churches and cathedrals, including many of Canterbury Cathedral and views of Lambeth Palace and its environs. The collection is also strong in satirical material relating to Church of England personnel and events in the Church’s history, and in portraits of of eminent persons, particularly ecclesiastical portraits. 

Selected images from The Roger Payton Collection of views of Lambeth Palace are available here.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/cathedral-library-collaboration/,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_cathedral_library_collaboration_.html,"Lambeth Palace Library would like to share its new building, and the resources and expertise we have here, with cathedral libraries and archives.

Project update, December 2023

In May 2023 we contacted cathedral archives and libraries to find out more about their needs. We asked each cathedral to rate ten suggestions in terms of potential benefit to them. These are suggestions which arose from initial conversations with a small number of cathedrals; Lambeth will not necessarily be in a position to offer each activity but we are keen to understand the full picture of cathedrals’ needs. You can read the ten ideas below, and see how cathedrals prioritised the suggestions.

Ten possible avenues for collaboration between Lambeth Palace Library and cathedrals:a) Digitisation serviceDigitisation carried out by Lambeth staff in Lambeth’s reprographics studio. Items would be assessed for suitability and volume through a video call; the material would need to be couriered to and from Lambeth.b) Digital image storage and public accessDevelopment and maintenance of a cross-cathedral image database, into which cathedrals could upload their images and users could search across multiple collections.c) Online exhibition platformDevelopment and maintenance of an online exhibition platform into which contributing cathedrals could upload content for their own individual displays and collaborate with others on common themes. This could be used for both multiple-exhibit projects or showcasing individual items.d) Preservation surveysSurveys undertaken by Lambeth’s collections care team to highlight the areas that individual cathedrals may wish to prioritise. This could cover buildings and environment, procedures and condition of collection items.e) Preservation suppliesDistribution at cost of small quantities of preservation material bought in bulk by Lambeth but which can be prohibitively expensive if bought separately by individual cathedrals.f) ConservationTreatment of selected items at Lambeth’s conservation studio; items would need to be couriered to the studio. A site visit by a member of Lambeth’s Collections Care team may be required for a preliminary assessment.g) Training on areas suggested by cathedral librariesFor instance, on running exhibitions or training volunteers / staff in aspects of collections care (see Q.6).h) Box-making serviceCreation of individual tailored boxes for collection items using Lambeth’s computerised box-making machine. This would require cathedral library staff to be trained in measuring items for phase boxes. i) Guide to Cathedral LibrariesCreation of a guide for students or new researchers to introduce them to the material they are likely to find in cathedral libraries and archives, and the tools that can help them navigate the collections.j) Use of Lambeth’s meeting / seminar rooms For cathedral library events.

23 cathedrals responded, equating to around 80% of cathedrals with relevant collections. The chart below is an extract from the survey results indicating how each of the suggestions listed above were rated, for instance, option ‘f’ from the list above was the most popular, with 23% of cathedrals putting this as their first choice. 

We are working through the responses from cathedrals and the questions they raise. Some of the suggestions, such as setting up an online exhibition platform or a digital image storage space are significant projects, while others such as training events and preservation surveys are quicker to get up and running. We are identifying areas where our capacity and skills match cathedrals’ needs and hope this will enable us to define a specific service to cathedrals in 2024.

If you have any thoughts or questions about this initiative, please do get in touch.

On the day of Lambeth Palace’s September Garden Open Day, Lambeth Palace Library will be running guided tours of the Library, including a chance to visit our Collections Care Studio and our amazing London view from our 8th floor terrace!

Tickets can be booked ahead of time via our Eventbrite page, with limited tickets also available on the day of the event.

This is not a ticket for the Garden Open Day, you will need to purchase these for £5 on the door at Lambeth Palace or via the Lia’s Wings Eventbrite page. All proceeds from the day will go to Lia’s Wings to support their work.

All visitors need to be aware of the following for the Garden Open Day:

Access to our exhibitions ‘Her Booke: Early Modern Women and their Books at Lambeth Palace Library’ and ‘Building on Cathedrals’ is NOT ticketed and free to all.

About ‘Her Booke: Early Modern Women and their Books at Lambeth Palace Library’:

This exhibition highlights material owned, written, commissioned, and translated by women during the long early modern period. It celebrates the ways in which women and their books were an integral part of England’s devotional, intellectual, and bibliographical cultures. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, the exhibition examines the production and use of books for personal and spiritual practices; books as a statement of power and piety; the development of the commercial trade in books; books as a site to demonstrate women’s intellectual ability; and the material evidence of women’s book ownership.

About ‘Building on Cathedrals:

In collaboration with Cardiff University Special Collections and Archives (SCA) and the University of Wyoming, Lambeth Palace Library is embarking on a groundbreaking digital project. This venture uses cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as caption detection and object recognition tools, to analyse the historical iconography of recently digitised material from the Library’s collections.

The Operations team are responsible for the a variety of services for Lambeth Palace Library, including the engagement and interaction with the general public and individuals wishing to view our collections, and also provide an internal records storage and retrieval service for NCI staff and also respond to diocesan enquiries. 

The Operations team also works with the Records Management team to ensure the proper use and storage of all current records, both electronic and paper, that are used throughout the Library, particularly through the management of filing systems. We also have a role in the implementation of any new systems that may be used for storing and retrieving files that are frequently used within the Library’s operations. 

For services to the National Church Institutions please see our pages on the Gateway. Access the Records Management guides here. 

We can aid with issues or questions relating to our record system, CALM RM, from setting up employees with a new CALM account to helping with loaning and returning files. We are also responsible for services such as ordering items required by staff and the Library, and ensuring the finances and invoices required for the library are up to date.

The Operations teams also organise and liaise with external organisations and groups to arrange tours of the Library, archives and conservation areas, allowing for people to see what happens behind the scenes in the Library and how we operate to house the record office of the Archbishops of Canterbury and the main archive for the documentary history of the Church of England.

We also liaise with a variety of internal departments, such as the Hospitality team, where we help with the organisation of events and bookings using the Library’s meeting rooms, ensuring that the Operations team are available to help with technology and any other issues that may arise when using the meeting rooms.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/whats-on/our-collections-on-loan/,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_whats_on_our_collections_on_loan_.html,"The Lambeth Bible, one of the finest surviving giant Bibles created in Romanesque England, will be on display at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Rouen, France from 14 April to 13 August 2023.

The Lambeth Bible, one of the finest surviving giant Bibles created in Romanesque England, will be on display at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Rouen, France from 14 April to 13 August 2023.

Select folios of the Bible have been digitised and are available to view here



The Lindisfarne Gospels, one of the most spectacular manuscript to survive from Anglo-Saxon England, will be on display at the Laing Art Gallery from 17 September to 3 December 2022, on loan from the British Library.

The exhibition includes a stunning selection of early medieval treasures, representing both personal and collective religious experiences in the 8th century. 

Lambeth Palace Library has lent the MacDurnan Gospels to the exhibition. 

The MacDurnan Gospels has been fully digitised in collaboration with the British Library and is available to view here. 

2020 marked the 400th anniversary of the sailing of the Mayflower from England to America. Plymouth was the ship’s final departure point in September 1620, so The Box curated the Mayflower 400: Legend and Legacy commemorative exhibition (running until 2 Jan 2022).

Created with the help of museums, libraries and archives across the UK, the US and The Netherlands, the exhibition has welcomed over 300 objects to Plymouth. They help visitors to explore early English attempts to colonise America, recognise the conflict and coexistence with Native America, understand the political and religious context for the sailing, discover the lives of the passengers, and consider the cultural, demographic and personal impact and legacies of the story. The exhibition was created with local, national and international partners, including tribal scholars of the Wampanoag Nation. As such, it tells a shared history across an ocean and 400 years.

Lambeth Palace Library supported the exhibition with the loan of four historic texts:

This publication brought England’s first attempt to create a colony in America to a wider audience. It features the account of Roanoake – the lost colony. Established from 1584-1590, this North Carolina colony was documented by Thomas Harriot and the artist John White. It’s story appears in Hakluyt’s extensive text and we were able to show visitors the pages with the names of those first English colonists to America – men, women and children.

This manuscript enabled The Box to tell the story of Popham – England’s forgotten colony of 1607. Established in Maine by primarily westcountry colonists, it lasted for a year, before being disbanded. This text is the only surviving diary, so is a significant historic and personal resource describing one of England’s earliest attempt to create colonies in America.

This text relates to the Mayflower story directly. The voyage was the idea of a group of Separatists living in Leiden. They were religious exiles from James I’s England. In Holland, some printed texts banned at home and smuggled them back into England. William Brewster was one of these printers, and was a Mayflower passenger in 1620.   

England’s early colonies in America, and publications about them, only encouraged more settlers to cross the Atlantic. Francis Higginson was one of them. He arrived in Massachusetts Bay in 1629, before the establishment of Boston, and was to write about the subsequent colony.   

While earlier texts came out about the Plymouth colony, it was William Bradford’s Of Plimoth Plantation that came to dominate the literature. Written between 1630 and 1651, it informed subsequent texts about the Mayflower and its passengers. However, the original manuscript was lost for several centuries, until it was rediscovered on this side of the Atlantic in 1854 – in Fulham Palace. Reprinted in 1856, it was not until 1897 that the text itself was returned to America. It is now part of the Massachusetts State Archives.

For further information please see The Box Plymouth’s website.

In an England and Scotland engulfed in religious turmoil and with civil wars raging on the continent, this major exhibition follows the storm that threatened these two powerful women as they struggled for control of the British Isles.

They never met but their fates were intertwined. From their shared beginnings, facing the challenge of ruling in a man’s world, feel the tension escalate as handwritten letters between the queens show how paranoia turned sisterly affection to suspicion. 

With the threat of conspiracy ever present, communications written in code reveal how Elizabeth used a network of spies to trap and destroy her rival, bringing the dramatic story to a swift and bloody conclusion. 

Lambeth Palace Library supported the exhibition with the loan of two historical texts:





These documents will be on display at the exhibition from 8 October 2021 to 20 February 2022. For further information please see the British Library’s website.

The new Collections Care studio is at the heart of the Library’s design and is central to its mission. The new studio is complemented by improved storage areas, replacing inadequate facilities at the Bermondsey warehouse and thirteen separate cramped rooms within Lambeth Palace. All stores in the new Library are temperature and humidity controlled and have fire suppression systems, allowing for better environmental control of the books and archives and ensuring that the cultural and religious heritage of the Church of England is safeguarded for the future and can be explored and enjoyed by all.

In 1950 a small bindery was created in Morton’s Tower to manage the conservation and rebinding of books damaged in the bombing of 1941. In the early years of this century the studio was refitted to deal with more archive-based conservation needs. However, it became increasingly clear that this would still not be enough to meet the ongoing needs of the collections or to ensure access to them in the long-term. A new purpose-built studio has been created in the new Library to enable more complex conservation treatments to be undertaken and to help maintain the collections in our care. 

Our new title is Collections Care, a term which describes holistically what we do in terms of interventive and preventive work to ensure the collections are protected from physical, chemical and environmental risk. Our team of conservation and preservation specialists focus on the conservation of the Library and archive collections, as well as assisting Westminster Abbey Library and Muniments on their conservation programme. 

In addition, the team proactively undertake a range of preservation tasks, such as condition assessments, surveys, pest and environmental monitoring, and actively support public engagement programmes, digitisation and exhibitions and the internal display processes. 

Lambeth Palace Library aims to share its collections with a wider audience as far as possible. The Library regularly lends to public exhibitions in libraries, galleries, and museums within the UK and abroad. To request a loan from the Library or see what items are currently on loan please visit our Exhibition Loans page.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/collections/sion-college-library/,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_collections_sion_college_library_.html,"In 1624 the Reverend Thomas White, Vicar of St. Dunstan in the West, left £3,000 in his will for the founding of Sion College, providing a meeting hall, lodgings and an almshouses for clergy. Although White’s will made no specific provision for a library, one was quickly established on the upper storey of the College building. Initially founded for the benefit of the clergy of the City of London, the Library rapidly became a resource used by the citizens of London as a whole, many of whom gave or bequeathed books. Merchants, doctors, lawyers, booksellers and bishops all found their way into the Library’s detailed benefactor records. 

Sion College Library was the pre-eminent library in London from its foundation until the establishment of the British Museum library in the 1750s. It was the first library in London to publish a printed catalogue (1650, and another in 1724) and the first, other than the royal library, to be awarded the legal deposit privilege of receiving books from Stationers’ Hall (from 1710 until 1836). Admission records for its readers show that by the 1650s Sion College Library was already attracting scholars from as far afield as New England and the Baltic. The historic importance of Sion College Library is greatly increased by the way in which its library records, manuscripts and the provenances of its printed books interconnect and supplement each other.When Sion College sold its building in 1996, the Library’s collections were split between two sites. The pre-1850 material, comprising 35,000 printed books, was transferred to the ownership of Lambeth Palace Library, together with the manuscripts, the library records and the entire pamphlets collection. In total the Library received some 65,000 items; the post-1850 collections were removed to King’s College London.

The Sion College collections were well documented in a series of catalogues and inventories produced from the foundation of the Library up until its closure.



There are approximately 35,000 printed books, many of which complement well the Lambeth collections. Out of 57 incunabula (books printed before 1501), 51 are editions previously lacking at Lambeth. There are some 1,600 STC and 4,000 Wing books. Significant collections were donated or bequeathed to Sion College by George Berkeley, Earl of Berkeley; Walter Travers, the puritan opponent of Richard Hooker; Henry Compton, bishop of London; John Lawson, M.D., brother-in-law of Archbishop Tenison; and Edward Waple, Vicar of St Sepulchre’s (1647-1712). Sion College Library also had a close relationship with the London book trade, which was the source of numerous donations of books on both a large and a small scale; both Thomas James (c.1650-1711), London bookseller and mathematical printer to the King, and Richard Chiswell (1640-1711), a bookseller in St. Paul’s Churchyard specialising in the works of Anglican divines, contributed significant collections. Other accessions of note include the Jesuit Library seized at the time of the Popish Plot and transferred to Sion College in 1679, around 500 books from the Library of Archbishop Tenison, and the Port Royal Library, collected in the first half of the 19th century.

The Advisory Board was established in 1917 as the Archbishops’ Advisory Board for Spiritual and Moral Work (AABSMW). The Board centralised the work of diocesan secretaries in moral welfare, increasing the supply of qualified workers and setting standards for their training. The Board’s object was to lead the way on questions of moral welfare, specifically those affecting Christian standards of sexual morality. The chief concern was with women and young girls, but in 1922 men were included in the Board’s membership.According to its entry in the 1922 Church of England Yearbook, the aims of the Advisory Board are stated as intending to be of use in the following ways:a) By increasing the supply of adequate teachersb) By setting a standard of training, in all branches of the workc) By collecting and imparting necessary and up-to-date and legislative informationd) by reporting progress and development of new methodse) By providing visitors and special speakers when asked to do sof) by advising in special difficulties and arranging for united action when desirableg) by arousing interest and initiating work in new centresIn January 1939 the Advisory Board became the Church of England Moral Welfare Council; for whose records see MWC. 

Papers of the ACCM Council and Committees, including minutes of meetings, documents circulated ahead of those meetings, inspection reports, working party papers, correspondence between ACCM Secretaries and ACCM members and with external bodies and individuals, occasional papers produced by ACCM, and general papers relating to the work done by ACCM in overseeing examinations and selection conferences, interacting with Theological Colleges and Training Courses – including administering of funds on behalf of the Church Assembly/General Synod and Trusts, and all other matters pertaining to Ministry.The Council was formed as a successor to the Central Advisory Council for the Ministry (CACM) in 1966, with the first meeting taking place on 3 May of that year. The main function was ‘to promote the most effective ministry, both of men and women, in the service of the Church and to make appropriate recommendations for this purpose to the Bishops and to the Church Assembly’. The majority of the work of the Council was undertaken by Committees, each with their own terms of reference to guide them.The council’s last meeting was held on 6 March 1991; its work was then continued by the Advisory Board of Ministry (ABM). 

The Archbishops’ Commission to Revise the Psalter was set up with the purpose of revising Coverdale’s edition of the psalter in order to make it more understandable and accessible. What resulted were five books containing revised versions of all 150 psalms.The Commission’s terms of reference: “To produce for the consideration of the Convocations a revision of the text of the Psalter designed to remove obscurities and various errors of translation, yet such as to retain, as far as possible, the general character in style and rhythm of Coverdale’s version and its suitability for congregational use.”

Papers of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Commission on Urban Priority Areas (ACUPA) relating to the research and producing of their report, ‘Faith in the City’ (1985), including correspondence, minutes, photographs, draft reports, and research papers. Also includes papers of the ‘Gallup Clergy Survey’, including reports, questionnaires, and pilot survey responses, which was commissioned as part of ACUPA’s research by Gallup Poll Ltd.The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Commission on the Urban Priority Areas (ACUPA) was established in 1983 by Robert Runcie (Archbishop of Canterbury 1980-91) in the wake of the inner city riots of the early 1980s, particularly in Brixton, and following the prompting of Bishops from urban dioceses.ACUPA’s aim was to investigate the situation faced by people living in inner cities and outlying housing estates, including issues such as unemployment, education, crime and health; and to explore the presence and involvement of the Church in these neighbourhoods. ACUPA’s findings, along with recommendations on how the Church, the government and society should respond to the issues highlighted, were published in the report, “Faith in the City: A Call to Action by Church and Nation” in December 1985 by Church House.

Records of the Committee of the Alternative Service Book: meeting minutes and documents; correspondence with publishers. Also included are various editions of the Alternative Service Book from authorised publishers and paper ‘separates’ (separate services from the ASB), some of which were forerunners to those that came with the publication of the Alternative Service Book in 1980.

In July 1973, the General Synod passed a resolution requesting the Standing Committee and the House of Bishops to establish a working party to ‘draw up detailed plans for the preparation and issue of a People’s Service Book Committee…’.The Working Party had, with the consent of the Standing Committee, reinterpreted its original terms of reference (which related to a ‘People’s Service Book’) and reported in favour of an ‘Alternative Service Book’; i.e., a book containing those forms of service authorised for use other than those of 1662. There would then be two Books in common use; the Book of Common Prayer and the ‘Alternative’ Book.

The Board for Mission and Unity was established to replace the Missionary and Ecumenical Council (MEC). At the first meeting it was stated that the ‘responsibilities of the new Board were considerably wider than those of the old Missionary and Ecumenical Council and more complex and technical’, and the four broad areas of work were to be: mission at home; mission overseas; unity at home; and unity overseas.

The archive comprises papers of the Board, its committees and sub-committees, and in relation to the work carried out under its Terms of Reference. Includes minutes of meetings, documents and papers circulated to Board or Committee members ahead of meetings, correspondence – both internal and external, and reports and articles used for background information on particular areas of interest. The collection also includes some material created by its predecessor, the Missionary and Ecumenical Council, which dates back to the 1940s, and of its successor, the Board of Mission, dating from 1995. 

The Board for Social Responsibility came into being on the 1st January 1958 as an Advisory Committee to the Church Assembly. Aiming ‘to promote and co-ordinate the thought and action of the Church in matters affecting family, social and industrial life’, it was an amalgamation of two earlier central Church bodies – the Church of England Moral Welfare Council (MWC) and the Social and Industrial Council (SIC).The collection contains records of the Board for Social Responsibility (BSR) and its sub-committees.In addition to a core of minutes, documents and papers detailing the work and administration of the Board and the sub-committees, the collection also contains a large quantity of files created by Working Parties set up by the Board to investigate specific issues. Within these files can generally be found minutes of meetings, correspondence between members, reports and papers circulated between the members, and background information papers. A small number of records of predecessor bodies to the BSR are also present.

The Church Assembly Council for Ecumenical Co-Operation (CACEC) was founded in 1949, with its terms of reference being:

‘To bring forward in the Church Assembly such matters arising out of the business either of the World Council of Churches or the British Council of Churches which require action by the Church of England’.Includes Council administrative papers, Secretary’s correspondence and the papers of the various bodies which were involved in the Anglican-Presbyterian Conversations which were held through the 1960s. Also includes papers in relation to an Ecumenical House for Prayer (Benifold), to which the Council Secretary acted as a Governor.

Papers of the Council (CACM), Sub-Committees and Working Parties. The Terms of Reference of the new Council, reconstituted of the Central Advisory Council of Training for the Ministry, were defined as follows:a) To keep under review the needs and opportunities of the Church for the ordained ministry, for Deaconesses, and the various forms of lay service, to make recommendations to the Bishops and the Church Assembly, and to serve those needs as and when directed to do so.b) To make recommendations as to the disbursement of monies received from the Church Assembly or elsewhere with which to finance the training of candidates for Holy Orders in conjunction with Diocesan Ordination Candidates Funds and other bodies engaged in the work of preparing candidates for Holy Orders; and similarly in regard to training of Deaconesses and for recognised forms of lay ministry.c) To approve places and courses of training for the ordained and lay ministry, and to advise upon all questions concerning their provision, maintenance, fees and economic management.d) To formulate in conjunction with the Central Board of Finance a policy of finance with regard to the capital needs of the Theological Colleges and Training Houses for women.

Papers of the Council (CACTM) and its Committees. Includes minutes of meetings, documents and correspondence.The Central Advisory Council of Training for the Ministry (CACTM) was established in 1912, with its work being carried out by a series of committees: General Purposes, Examinations, Inspections, Selection, Recruitment, Post-Ordination Training and Grants.At the meeting of 19 February 1913 the functions of the Council were stated as follows: To watch the supply of candidates for Holy Orders, and its sources.

a) To consider the best methods for training and testing candidates.b) To draw up, and from time to time revise, a list of Theological Colleges their recognition of which the Bishop advises.c) To provide for the inspection of existing Theological Colleges; and advise as to the formation and supply of new Theological Colleges.d) Generally to promote unity of action between all those concerned in the training of candidates for Holy Orders, and to collect information and make suggestions of the guidance of Bishops.

The Council for the Care of Churches was originally formed to co-ordinate and assist the work of the Diocesan Advisory Committees. Its function was to advise the General Synod on the construction and care of churches, and act on Synod’s behalf in contacts with government and professional bodies over church inspection and repair. It also provided financial aid for the conservation of furnishings and works of art in churches as well as advice on specific conservation issues and on new churches.The collection contains papers of the Council and its principal Committees; including the Conservation Committee, its Secretariat, papers of the Conservation Committee’s Sub-Committees, and papers related to their activities. It also reflects the Council’s dealings with external bodies, including dealings with Diocesan Advisory Committees and General Synod bodies as well as the private sector.It also includes papers from different deposits within topic and theme-based classes on aspects of churches: their exteriors and interiors, and their furnishings and contents.

HM Church Building Commission was founded in 1818 for building and promoting the building of additional churches in populous parishes as a solution to the increasingly inadequate church accommodation found in the expanding cities and towns of England and Wales. Essentially the Commissioners’ main functions included: inquiring into the state of the parishes to ascertain those needing extra church accommodation; granting money for building the extra churches and chapels; accepting the conveyance of sites for churches, chapels, burial grounds and parsonages, as well as houses for parsonages; approving the architectural plans, appraising and choosing the tenders, monitoring budgets and generally overseeing the building; dividing parishes into ecclesiastical districts for the new churches; establishing tables of pew rents for these churches and chapels; and church building repairs. The Church Building Commission archive is arranged into six thematic series of records, which best represent the form and function of the Commission: CBC/1 foundation; CBC/2 corporate governance; CBC/3 parliamentary papers; CBC/4 corporate financial; CBC/7 operational records and CBC/14 artefacts. Series CBC/2, CBC/3, CBC/4 and CBC/7 consist of both sub-series and file level descriptions, whereas series CBC/1 and CBC/14 only consists of file level descriptions.

Central Boards of Mission of the Church of England came to being in 1908 by constituting United Boards of Mission (see collection UBM) as the Central Boards of Mission of the Church of England.

Its functions were stated as follows:

a) To impress upon all members of the Church in such ways as from time to time may seem desirable, their responsibility as to Foreign Missions, and to set forth the principles which ought to govern the Missionary work of the Church.b) To issue reports from time to time on the spiritual wants of heathen countries, and to direct attention to the opening providentially placed.c) To give counsel when applied to by any Colonial or Missionary Church.d) To act as referee on questions which Missionary Societies may desire to refer to the Board. e) To collect and tabulate, as far as be found desirable and practicable, as Acts and Canons passed in the various Synods of the Church at home and abroad.f) To undertake any other work in connection with Missions which may from time to time be entrusted to the Board either by the Archbishops, or by the Convocations of Canterbury or York.

In 1921 Missionary Council of the Church Assembly was established to take the place of the Central Board.

The Commissioners manage the Church of England investment fund. The money they make from those investments contribute to the cost of mission projects, dioceses in low-income areas, bishops, cathedrals, and pensions. The Church Commissioners also provide administrative support for Church. The Commissioners inherited the property and functions of Queen Anne’s Bounty (1704-1948) and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (1836-1948) after the merge of the two bodies and creation of the Church Commissioners in 1948. This archive is currently in the process of being catalogued and new entries are being added to the existing catalogue. Records available for research so far include Annual Reports, meeting papers of the Commissioners Board of Governors and papers of the Secretary to the Church Commissioners.

When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners began to take over the estates and manage them, there was concern expressed that private individuals affected as lessees might find the Commissioners’ terms onerous and might then be without redress, since there was nobody in the House of Commons directly representing the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Therefore, an Act was subsequently passed adding three additional laymen to be known as the Church Estates Commissioners. Of the three, two were to be paid (one being appointed by the Crown as the First Church Estates Commissioner and the other being appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury as the Third Church Estates Commissioner), their duties involved the management and control of the day to day business of the Commissioners.Their archive includes foundation, corporate and financial records. Also includes reports and records generated by the Commissioners’ property and investment management activities (deeds and ledgers).

The Council for Overseas Settlement was formed in the spring of 1925, but became known as the Church of England Council for Empire Settlement (CECES) almost immediately. The SIC report recommended that the functions of the new Council should include the following: ‘dissemination of information as to openings in the various dominions of the British Commonwealth for settlers’; ‘the selection and shipping of settlers’; the arrangement for spiritual ministrations on the voyage out and letters of commendatory from the clergy’; ‘the provision, in conjunction with the Church, for the reception, placing, and after-care of these settlers’.

Records of the Church of England Council for Empire Settlement include: various committees’ minutes; annual reports; operational registers; agreements; correspondence.

The Church of England Purity Society was formed in 1883, following requests on the part of the Church Penitentiary Society, the Lower House of Convocation, Ellice Hopkins and others for a concerted effort to be made by the Church in the field of reformatory work.

The objects, as approved by the Council in February 1884, were:

a) Purity among menb) A chivalrous respect for womanhoodc) The preservation of the young from contaminationd) Rescue worke) A higher tone of public opinion

The papers comprise minute books and the Society’s monthly paper, ‘The Vanguard’.

The Church Information Office was the successor to the Press and Publications Board and the Church Information Board.

CIO was responsible, through the Church Information Committee, to the Standing Committee of the Church Assembly and later General Synod.

The CIO activities included issuing press releases, answering press enquiries, arranging press conferences and facilities. Its publications department was serving as a publisher to the Church Assembly and later General Synod. The Radio and Television section provided services for the programme planners, producers and news editors of BBC and other broadcasters.

The photographic department created a comprehensive library of photographs illustrating various aspects of religious and social life in the UK.

The CIO archive collection reflects all the above listed activities and its photographic library forms a very attractive visual resource.

Selected photographs from the collection are available here.

The Clergy Pensions Institution was conceived as a means to facilitate the retirement of the clergy. Its methods were self-help on the part of individual members of the clergy who purchased an annual subscription, graduated according to age, that secured him an annuity upon retirement at the age of 65. In addition, he would have a claim, on becoming unbeneficed, to a proportionate share in a general fund derived from extraneous sources such as donations or legacies.The collection includes volumes of signed minute books recording the meetings of the Clergy Pensions Institution (CPI). This includes annual meetings, board meetings and committee meetings of the Institution, among others.

The 1921 revision of the Regulations of the Convocations recommended the setting up of a Central Readers’ Board to “co-ordinate the organisation in the Dioceses, and to maintain and develop the work of Readers generally, under the authority of the Archbishops and Bishops.” The constitution was approved, and the Board formally established with each diocese to be represented by two members, one of whom must be a lay man. Membership of the Board was voluntary, and its work was financed by contributions from diocesan Readers’ boards and individual private subscriptions.The Central Readers’ Board provided opportunities for members to meet and discuss common work and problems and aimed to develop consensus and guidance on matters concerning Readers.The archive includes records generated by the Board’s foundation and its operational activities. Also includes meeting papers, photographs and artefacts.

The Royal Commission was appointed by Letters Patent, dated 28 January 1830, to enquire into the procedures and operations of the Ecclesiastical Courts. The Commission’s recommendations included the abolition of the High Court of Delegates, with its functions transferred to a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that all ecclesiastical courts below provincial level be abolished, and for the introduction of trial by jury including the admissibility of oral evidence.

The Ecclesiastical Commissioners archive incorporates the activities of the Church Building Commissioners (1818-56), the Church Estates Commissioners (1850-1936) and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England (1835-1948), and some of the works of the Church Commissioners (from 1948).Approximately 16,000 linear feet of files, bound volumes, plans and maps reflecting the following activities of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners:

• Management of the preferment estates including bishopric and cathedral estates and its other investments• Benefice administration including legislation through the Orders In Council implementing changes in the church structure for example the creation and amalgamation of benefices and the regulation of benefice assets for example giving consent to sales of glebe land• Augmentation of poorer benefices through loans for new parsonage houses and grants in support of clergy stipends• Financial and administrative support for the development of the ministry of the Bishops and the Cathedrals• Various ad hoc administrative functions acquired through legislation for example administering the City Church Fund for the Metropolitan area

In 1948 the ECE was merged with Queen Anne’s Bounty forming the Church Commissioners.

The Episcopal and Capitular Revenues Commission was a Royal Commission reporting to Parliament, brought into being in 1849 to examine the issue of the leasing and management of the properties of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and those owned by various Ecclesiastical preferments such as the estates of the bishops and cathedrals. The Commission considered various proposals on how Ecclesiastical lands could be better managed to increase the income for the Church, whilst balancing the rights and needs of the lessees holding the properties at the time. The Commission consisted of Lord Harrowby, Dean Lyall, William Page Wood (later to be known as Lord Hatherly), Robert Armstrong, Richard Jones, the tithes commissioner, and J.G. Shaw Lefevre.

On 4th February 1835, a Royal Commission was appointed to consider the state of the revenues of dioceses in England and Wales, the more even distribution of Episcopal duties, investigate the state of cathedral and collegiate churches and the best means of improving parish ministry and in particular providing for the clergy to reside in their benefices. The Ecclesiastical and Revenues Commission was known as the ‘Ecclesiastical Commission’ and sometimes was called the ‘Church Enquiry Commission’.The Commission’s proceedings consisted of the Commission hearing witnesses, receiving reports and discussions leading to resolutions that recorded the Commission’s conclusions. The Commission appointed a committee of its members who drafted sections of the report and submitted them for approval by the whole Commission before submitting them to Parliament and their subsequent publication.

The legislative assemblies of the provinces of Canterbury and York, the convocations of Canterbury and York, have met since the fifteenth century. Each contained two houses: the upper house comprised bishops, the lower house clergy. In 1919, the creation of the National Assembly of the Church of England (otherwise known as the Church Assembly) brought together the two upper houses (the House of Bishops) and the two lower houses (the House of Clergy), which, together with the House of Laity, made up the three houses of the Assembly.

When, in 1970, the Church Assembly was replaced by the General Synod, the Houses of Bishops, Clergy and Laity continued as the three houses of the Synod. Although the upper and lower houses of the two convocations started meeting jointly in the early twentieth century, they also continued to meet separately within their separate convocations.

The Hospital Chaplaincies Commission was appointed by the Church Assembly in 1946 to enquire into the Church’s ministration to mentally ill people in institutions, to consult with the Minister of Health re. the future of the provision of such a service in the National Health Service (NHS), the specific training for the role, and the status of chaplains in other types of health institution.

The Council was reconstituted by General Synod in 1972. Its functions were:a) to consider questions, put to it by General Synod, of spiritual ministration of patients in hospitals.b) to advise diocesan Bishops and Chaplains’ Advisory Committees on such matters.c) to monitor such matters in hospitals on behalf of General Synod.d) to co-ordinate relations between Chaplains’ Advisory Committees. e) to liaise with the DHSS on such matters. f) to arrange national training courses for Chaplains.

The Missionary Council was established in 1921 by the Church Assembly to take the place of the Central Board of Missions, and the first meeting of the Missionary Council was held on 1st February 1922.

At the meeting the general functions of the Council were considered to be with regard to the provision of Missionaries, provision of funds, and ‘overseas problems’. These functions were then extrapolated to cover administrative difficulties, relations with other Missionary Boards, the relationship with missionary work of other Churches and organisation of a home base.

The collection includes records of the Council and its staff. Includes minutes of meetings of the Council and its sub-committees, reports and documents, correspondence, pamphlets and brochures, and financial records in relation to the Funds and Legacies administered by the Council.

The Missionary and Ecumenical Council (MECCA) was formed by the Church Assembly in February 1963, to continue and develop the work of the Overseas Council (OC) and the Council for Ecumenical Co-operation (CACEC). The purpose of the new Council was to ‘continue and develop work previously carried out by the Overseas Council and the Council for Ecumenical Co-operation’. Some records of the Council can be found in the archive of its successor, the Board for Mission and Unity (search catalogue for BMU). 

Comprises records of the Council and its staff, with the collection being a combination of general files and the files created and maintained by the MECCA Secretaries. Included are papers and documents, minutes of meetings of the Council and its sub-Committees, correspondence between MECCA staff and organisations and individuals from both within the Church and externally, reports on subjects related to the work of MECCA, pamphlets and brochures, and some financial records relating to Trusts and Legacies administered by the Council.

The Marriage Commission, set up in 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Bishop of Lichfield, grew out of the discussions of earlier Committees and Working Groups, whose papers, along with others, have been kept together in this archive (MRC).

The Church of England Moral Welfare Council (MWC) was formed in 1938-39, through the amalgamation of the Church of England Advisory Board for Moral Welfare, and the White Cross League. According to the revised constitution of 1939, the aim was to act as a central council of the Church for the ‘co-ordination of thought and action in relation to the place of sex, marriage and the family in the Christian life’. The Council endeavoured to realise this aim by acting as a centre for collecting and circulating information on moral welfare, which encompassed producing its own publications; providing lecturers to visit camps and towns, universities and theological colleges; and to unify the work undertaken in dioceses.

The National Society was founded on 16th November 1811 and incorporated by Charter in 1817 as the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor throughout England and Wales.The bulk of the archive is comprised of a series of 16,000 school files relating to schools in England and in Wales. The files contain applications for National Society Building Grants, supporting papers, annual reports, architectural plans and sometimes the trust deeds.The archive also includes various minute book series including that of its governing body and a set of annual reports from 1811 onwards.In addition, the archive contains an extensive collection of the Society’s own publications. These mainly date from the latter half of the 19th century onwards, with books published by the Society’s Depository and also in conjunction with the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK).Another interesting series are glass plate negatives and positives showing images of school buildings (interiors and exteriors), classes and activities and teaching aids.

Selected images from the collection are available here.

The Colonial Bishoprics’ Fund was created in 1841 to provide ‘for the endowment of bishoprics in such of the foreign possessions of Great Britain as shall be determined upon by the Archbishops and Bishops of the United Church of England and Ireland ‘. The archive consists of the following:

The Ordination Candidates Exhibition Fund was a committee formed following an informal meeting in June 1873 with the stated aim: 

‘That it is desirable to assist eligible young men desirous of becoming clergymen but lacking the pecuniary means required to obtain the necessary education and for that purpose to raise what funds may be needed’. The archive includes minutes of meetings, Annual Reports and lists of candidates applying for and in receipt of funding.

The Prison Chaplaincies Council was constituted after the Report of the second Prisons Commission (see CAA/1958/10), summer 1961, and began its work early in 1962. It was reconstituted as a General Synod body in July 1972. It ceased to exist in February 1976, after which the Board for Social Responsibility set up the Prison Chaplaincies Advisory Group.Its functions were:a) To act as a liaison between the Church of England and the Prison Commissioners on all questions relating to spiritual ministration in prisons, borstals and remand and detention centres.b) To advise the Church Assembly, diocesan Bishops and other persons and bodies connected with the Church of England, on such questions.c) To consider and promote the supply of suitable applicants for prison chaplaincies.d) To promote and assist in co-operation with the Prison Commissioners the provision of training for chaplains and prospective chaplains.e) To advise and assist rural deaneries and parishes in their efforts.

The Act of 2 & 3 Anne, c. 11, empowered the Queen to establish a corporation in which would be invested the revenues of first fruits and tenths. The Queen Anne’s Bounty was subsequently founded by a Charter of 1704 and followed by a supplementary Charter of 1714 that amended its rules and constitution and how its officers were to be appointed. The collection is formed by the surviving archive of the Bounty which includes charters, letters patent, correspondence, working files and parsonage house plans, and reflects the following activities of the QAB:a) Endowment of benefices and their incomeb) Making various types of grants to the poorer benefices including:• Dilapidations grants• Improvement of existing and provision of new parsonage houses• Purchase of glebe land

In 1948 the QAB was merged with Ecclesiastical Commissioners forming the Church Commissioners.

Reconstituted in 1951. This new revised body was to be called the ‘Social and Industrial Council of the Church Assembly’.

Its functions were to be as follows: ‘to consider social, industrial and economic questions referred to it by the Church Assembly or by the Archbishops’; ‘to bring to the attention of the Church Assembly social, industrial and economic questions, to indicate as far as may be the religious and moral issues involved, and to provide the Assembly, by means of reports its judgement on such questions’.

In 1958 the Council was brought under the supervision of the newly formed Board of Social Responsibility (BSR).

The Board of Missions of the Province of Canterbury was established in 1884 following a Resolution by both Houses of Convocation. The Board was created to encourage engagement with missionary work and to explain the Church’s principles on the subject; to provide advice to colonial churches and missionary societies; and to issue reports on ‘the spiritual wants of heathen countries’.

The archive comprises minutes of the joint meetings of the Provincial Boards for the two provinces and subsequently minutes of the meetings of the United Boards and sub-committees.

Papers of the White Cross League and, post 1939, of the White Cross Committee of the Church of England Moral Welfare Council. The White Cross League started life as the White Cross Society in 1883.The organisation was formed to undertake rescue and preventive work to combat what it saw as threats to the ‘purity’ of society. Unlike many of the organisations tackling prostitution at the time, the White Cross Society concentrated its efforts on men, encouraging them to take responsibility for reducing the phenomenon.

The collection consists of fifty-five Greek manuscripts acquired by the Library since its founding in 1610, including those received from Sion College in 1996. The manuscripts date from the tenth to the nineteenth centuries and include: 

Among the most important manuscripts is MS 461, containing a theological treatise on the procession of the Holy Spirit by George Scholarios (later Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Gennadios II), with his autograph signature, notes and corrections. This was left to the Library by Archbishop Abbot (d.1633).

Many of the manuscripts (MS 1175-1207) were collected during his visits to the eastern Mediterranean by J.D. Carlyle, Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, for a proposed new critical edition of the New Testament which was left unfinished on his death in 1804, though collations by Carlyle’s assistants can be found in MS 1255.  Some of the Carlyle manuscripts were returned to their rightful owner, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, following their acquisition from Carlyle’s heir by Archbishop Manners-Sutton in 1806.  The work of collation was carried on by Charles Burney who left the fruits of his examination of the Carlyle manuscripts to the Library on his death in 1817 (MS 1223-1224, 1259).

The Library is grateful to The A. G. Leventis Foundation for a generous grant to fund the cataloguing of these manuscripts by Dr Christopher Wright and Ms Maria Argyrou under the supervision of Dr Charalambos Dendrinos and for our ongoing collaboration with the Hellenic Institute, Royal Holloway University of London.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/about-lambeth-palace-library/history-of-the-library/,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_about_lambeth_palace_library_history_of_the_library_.html,"Lambeth Palace Library is the historic library and record office of the Archbishops of Canterbury and the national library and archive of the Church of England. Its collections have been freely available for research from 1610, when it was founded under the will of Archbishop Richard Bancroft.

Bancroft bequeathed to his successors a collection of around 5,600 printed books (many deriving from his predecessor Archbishop John Whitgift) and about 500 manuscripts. His successor, George Abbot, arranged for the first catalogue to be compiled, enlisting the aid of King James I himself, who saw the new Library as ‘a monument of fame’ in his kingdom. Archbishop Abbot, in his turn, left over 2,500 books and 50 manuscripts to the Library. All three archbishops had been able to take advantage of the unprecedented book-collecting opportunities offered by the dispersal of the monastic libraries in the sixteenth century. Lambeth Palace Library soon became one of the most important libraries in England.

Following the royalist defeat in the Civil War and Parliament’s confiscation of Lambeth Palace, Cambridge University petitioned Parliament to have the Library. By then it numbered around 9,000 volumes and these were sent to join the collections of the University Library in Cambridge, probably in 1648. At the Restoration, Archbishop Juxon called for the books to be restored to Lambeth, but he did not live to see their return in 1664, during the time of his successor, Gilbert Sheldon. Archbishop Sheldon rebuilt the Library’s accommodation, around the cloister, and also bequeathed his own books and manuscripts. During the rest of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries some archbishops, such as William Sancroft, Thomas Tenison and Thomas Secker, took a keen interest in the Library. Their librarians, Edmund Gibson, David Wilkins and Andrew Coltée Ducarel, organised the collections and provided some continuity. Many of Tenison and Secker’s books and papers remain at Lambeth, although the important collections of Sancroft himself and of Archbishop William Wake went elsewhere.

The first half of the nineteenth century saw further growth of the collections. Archbishop Manners-Sutton was responsible for the purchase in 1806 of the Greek manuscripts collected by J.D. Carlyle and also deposited his own committee papers relating to the insanity of King George III. Printed catalogues of the Library were produced – of manuscripts, by Henry Todd, in 1812 and of early printed books, by Samuel Roffey Maitland, in 1843 and 1845. The Library changed physically too, when Archbishop Howley commissioned the architect Edward Blore to rebuild Lambeth Palace. Many of the old buildings were demolished and the Library was transferred to the Great Hall, the seventeenth-century former banqueting hall, in 1830.

The middle of the century marked the beginning of a long period of decline, owing to chronic underfunding. The Library had been financed from the revenues of the Archbishops’ estates, but after 1836 these revenues passed into the control of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. From the 1860s onwards, the Commissioners allocated annual grants for running the Library. Although these gradually increased, they were generally inadequate. By the early twentieth century the costs of an assistant were being met partly out of the Librarian’s own pocket, though it was reported that he could not afford a boy old enough to carry the heavier books.

The Library was badly damaged during World War II. In 1941, incendiary bombs hit the Great Hall, damaging or destroying about 10,000 books. The chaos that ensued might well have marked the end of Lambeth Palace Library, but instead it eventually ushered in what amounted to a re-foundation. With the help of the Pilgrim Trust and the determined support of Archbishop Fisher, the Great Hall was restored, books were repaired and a new reading room was created.

In 1953, the Library was redefined as the main special library for the history of the Church of England, with additional responsibilities as a repository and research centre for Church of England archives. In 1996 it also took into its care the substantial pre-1850 manuscript and printed collections of Sion College library (founded 1629), the historic library of the City of London clergy. Lambeth Palace Library’s move to a purpose-built new building, which opened in 2021, has provided the opportunity to unite its archival collections with those of the former Church of England Record Centre and will ensure that all the Library’s collections are preserved in the best conditions and made more widely available in the future.

“Nothing in England astonished me as much as Lambeth Library – I had never thought there were so many books in all the world.”

Access to our exhibitions ‘Her Booke: Early Modern Women and their Books at Lambeth Palace Library’ and ‘Building on Cathedrals’ is NOT ticketed and free to all.

About ‘Her Booke: Early Modern Women and their Books at Lambeth Palace Library’:

This exhibition highlights material owned, written, commissioned, and translated by women during the long early modern period. It celebrates the ways in which women and their books were an integral part of England’s devotional, intellectual, and bibliographical cultures. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, the exhibition examines the production and use of books for personal and spiritual practices; books as a statement of power and piety; the development of the commercial trade in books; books as a site to demonstrate women’s intellectual ability; and the material evidence of women’s book ownership.

About ‘Building on Cathedrals:

In collaboration with Cardiff University Special Collections and Archives (SCA) and the University of Wyoming, Lambeth Palace Library is embarking on a groundbreaking digital project. This venture uses cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as caption detection and object recognition tools, to analyse the historical iconography of recently digitised material from the Library’s collections.

If you do not have a reference to a particular file, but believe the series below may be relevant to your research, you can contact us with an enquiry.

For the most part, the central archives of these two bodies, as well as many of their subsidiaries, such as the Board of Education and Central Board of Finance, are not included on the online catalogue. As cataloguing progresses, sections of these archives will appear in the database, but if cannot find what you are looking for, please contact us.

This is the central file series of the Ecclesiastical and subsequently Church Commissioners, and dates from the 1830s onwards. It runs to around 120,000 files although only a small proportion currently feature in the catalogue. The catalogue record for the series can be viewed here. Topics covered include:

The files have numerical references between 1 and 100,000 (although not all the files have survived) sometimes prefixed F, FN, or File Number. The reference in the current archive catalogue will be ECE/7/1/… (followed by up to 5 digits).

These files may be identifiable either in the Related Material field of other catalogue records, or by staff who can access the original card index. The vast majority of the files were indexed on the basis of the benefice to which they related, therefore identifying files relevant to a particular geographical area is easier than searching for specific topics.

A large collection documenting property holdings of the central Church, numbered with six figure references, sometimes prefixed D…

Note that most of the medieval and early modern deeds from this series have been transferred to local record offices, and other deeds have been handed away on sale of the property.

Deeds can be requested if researchers have found a reference in the Related Material field of other catalogue records, or in other physical records. Consulting maps within our archive (often to be found in the series ECE/11…) is frequently a good starting point in searching for deeds: property owned by the Ecclesiastical or Church Commissioners would often be shaded onto the maps and the deed numbers written on the relevant parcels of land.

Both these series are an excellent resource for architectural history, conservators and for anybody researching the material culture of church buildings, fixtures and fittings. Only an internal finding aid exists for these archives, so please consult staff for further information.

These records were produced by the Church Commissioners’ committee that dealt with issues relating to pastoral care in the case of closing churches. Initially this was the responsibility of the Commissioners’ Administrative Committee (1948-64), later the Pastoral Committee (1964-68) and subsequently the work fell to the Redundant Churches Committee.

Created by the Bishoprics Department, these files relate to the department’s responsibility for supervision of all aspects of the construction, maintenance and renovation of the bishops’ official episcopal residences, also known as See Houses. The series was created in the mid C20th and is awaiting cataloguing.



Other material is included in the online public catalogue but lacks the detail that can be found in published finding aids elsewhere:

Marriage licence data from the Faculty Office, 1714-1850, and Vicar General, 1694-1850, indexes are available in the Library, or online via FindMyPast www.findmypast.co.uk (to subscribers) or via the Society of Genealogists www.sog.org.uk/index.shtml (to SoG members).

For detailed information on the contents of the Archbishops’ registers, consult published editions, or indexes held on site in the Library

A partial index of National Society teachers can be consulted at the Library. The index directs researchers to relevant documents within the National Society archive.

The archive of the Queen Anne’s Bounty contains a series of architectural plans relating to parsonage houses. The existing files up to 1920 have been included in the online catalogue, but for later files, consult CERCA/3/5/1/1451, which is an index to the series.

https://www.lambethpalacelibrary.info/cathedral-library-collaboration/?preview=true,html_files\www_lambethpalacelibrary_info_cathedral_library_collaboration__preview=true.html,"Lambeth Palace Library would like to share its new building, and the resources and expertise we have here, with cathedral libraries and archives.

Project update, December 2023

In May 2023 we contacted cathedral archives and libraries to find out more about their needs. We asked each cathedral to rate ten suggestions in terms of potential benefit to them. These are suggestions which arose from initial conversations with a small number of cathedrals; Lambeth will not necessarily be in a position to offer each activity but we are keen to understand the full picture of cathedrals’ needs. You can read the ten ideas below, and see how cathedrals prioritised the suggestions.

Ten possible avenues for collaboration between Lambeth Palace Library and cathedrals:a) Digitisation serviceDigitisation carried out by Lambeth staff in Lambeth’s reprographics studio. Items would be assessed for suitability and volume through a video call; the material would need to be couriered to and from Lambeth.b) Digital image storage and public accessDevelopment and maintenance of a cross-cathedral image database, into which cathedrals could upload their images and users could search across multiple collections.c) Online exhibition platformDevelopment and maintenance of an online exhibition platform into which contributing cathedrals could upload content for their own individual displays and collaborate with others on common themes. This could be used for both multiple-exhibit projects or showcasing individual items.d) Preservation surveysSurveys undertaken by Lambeth’s collections care team to highlight the areas that individual cathedrals may wish to prioritise. This could cover buildings and environment, procedures and condition of collection items.e) Preservation suppliesDistribution at cost of small quantities of preservation material bought in bulk by Lambeth but which can be prohibitively expensive if bought separately by individual cathedrals.f) ConservationTreatment of selected items at Lambeth’s conservation studio; items would need to be couriered to the studio. A site visit by a member of Lambeth’s Collections Care team may be required for a preliminary assessment.g) Training on areas suggested by cathedral librariesFor instance, on running exhibitions or training volunteers / staff in aspects of collections care (see Q.6).h) Box-making serviceCreation of individual tailored boxes for collection items using Lambeth’s computerised box-making machine. This would require cathedral library staff to be trained in measuring items for phase boxes. i) Guide to Cathedral LibrariesCreation of a guide for students or new researchers to introduce them to the material they are likely to find in cathedral libraries and archives, and the tools that can help them navigate the collections.j) Use of Lambeth’s meeting / seminar rooms For cathedral library events.

23 cathedrals responded, equating to around 80% of cathedrals with relevant collections. The chart below is an extract from the survey results indicating how each of the suggestions listed above were rated, for instance, option ‘f’ from the list above was the most popular, with 23% of cathedrals putting this as their first choice. 

We are working through the responses from cathedrals and the questions they raise. Some of the suggestions, such as setting up an online exhibition platform or a digital image storage space are significant projects, while others such as training events and preservation surveys are quicker to get up and running. We are identifying areas where our capacity and skills match cathedrals’ needs and hope this will enable us to define a specific service to cathedrals in 2024.

If you have any thoughts or questions about this initiative, please do get in touch.

Brixton Library in the heart of Brixton, on Windrush Square is a beautiful Grade II listed building. 

On the ground floor there is the children’s library, adult fiction and a gallery room that can be hired for events. On the first floor there is a large non-fiction library, quiet study space and a reference library. The library is open 7 days a week.

Brixton Library is open; however, it is undergoing refurbishment. During this period, there will be occasional noise within the building, and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

The first stage of the works, which involved installing new toilets, including a dedicated toilet in the children’s library, is now complete. Work to install a new lift providing access to all floors, including new rooms for events and activities, and rooms for hire in our basement, is ongoing. Finally, we will be reconfiguring the children’s library to make it bigger and more secure.

We are very grateful to those members who gave us their feedback via our survey, by writing to us and at our consultation events. 

Building Connections will deliver on our long-term vision to improve access to the collection and create more spaces for members and Library partners to read, write and connect. The project will enable us to support the needs of our growing membership, ensure our long-term sustainability for the Library and increase our public impact, while maintaining the Library’s unique and much-loved atmosphere and character.

As part of the communication for the project emailed to all members on 8 May, we shared a survey, reminders in our newsletters and the brochure was posted to all members. We received 147 responses to the feedback survey, of which 59% had a positive overall impression of the plans and the majority of those were very positive. Of the 29% who were not positive (12% were neutral) about the proposals the majority did see merit in some elements of the plans. Members are keenly supportive of the 6th floor plans, especially the café and roof terrace, whether it was to meet other members or simply to buy lunch without leaving the Library.

Respondents were happy to see the inclusion of a second lift. We have heard, understandably that members are concerned about the disruption and we, our architects and construction partners will do all we can to keep this to a minimum. We thank all respondents for taking the time to give their feedback and for their constructive comments.

https://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/about-us/podcast,html_files\www_londonlibrary_co_uk_about_us_podcast.html,"Each month the guest will be in conversation with The London Library’s Director, Philip Marshall and will delve into the Library’s archive and collection to uncover treasured books and nuggets of historical detail about the guest’s book choices.

The London Library Podcast is a celebration of books and the ideas they inspire and a personal love letter from each guest to the books that have been most influential to them.

 



For the latest in our podcast series, recorded just before the Library building closed, we are delighted to welcome musician, broadcaster and editor Jarvis Cocker. 

For his podcast, Jarvis introduced five books that that have been particularly influential to him:

The first is Grimm’s Household Tales. For Jarvis there was something particularly appealing about the way the tales were collected rather than written from scratch. In complete contrast is Richard Brautigan’s Sombrero Fallout, a chance find picked up in a secondhand book shop.

Jarvis’ next choice The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, made an equal impression as characters imagine their lives away from the drab world they inhabit, and find ways to relate and pour out their feelings. Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari “haunted me for quite a time”. Jarvis had chosen it on holiday “but it isn’t beach reading and it actually really frightened me”.

Jarvis’s final podcast choice is The Book of the Secrets by Bagwhan Shree Rajneesh. He had been fascinated by the lurid Netflix documentary The Wild, Wild Country - about the movement creating a lavish settlement in Oregon. But he was more intrigued about the unanswered question of why the movement was so popular and what it had to say about approaching the mental overstimulation of 21st century life.



 



The latest London Library podcast features Rough Trade’s Nigel House who takes us through the books that have made an impact on him throughout his life including Swallows and Amazons by Arthur Ransome, Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack, The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad, Canada by Richard Ford and The Rings of Saturn by WG Sebald.





In episode 5 of The London Library Podcast, we are joined by Valerie Brandes, the founder and publisher of diversity-focused, independent publishing house Jacaranda Books.

Valerie talks about identity, motherhood and the books that have shaped her life and career - from moving to America, then back to Hackney and setting up her own publishing business. As well as Jacaranda's Twentyin2020 initiative, which The London Library is currently supporting, promoting Black British writing through exclusively dedicating a year of publishing output to 20 Black British writers.





For the fourth episode of The London Library Podcast we are joined by Ahsan Akbar - a London Library member, poet, co-founder of the Dhaka Literary Festival and owner of Teatulia tea shop and bar in Covent Garden.

In conversation with The London Library’s Director, Philip Marshall, Ahsan discusses the books that have shaped his life, including The Buddha of Suburbia by Hanif Kureishi; A Bend in the River by V S Naipaul; Money by Martin Amis; Virginia Woolf's Orlando and Reunion by Fred Uhlman.

Philip Marshall talks to actor and rare book dealer Neil Pearson about five books that have shaped his life, schooling and various career choices.

His book selection includes the Jennings series, Henry Miller and Hard Rain Falling by Don Carpenter.



This month we're delighted to be joined by London Library member and Sunday Times Top Ten bestselling author, Harriet Evans. 

Harriet's book choices include: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by CS Lewis; The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾ by Sue Townsend, The Light Years by Elizabeth Jane Howard and I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith.



Hallie Rubenhold’s book choices are: Little House on the Prairie by Laura Ingalls Wilder; Les Miserables by Victor Hugo; The Family, Sex and Marriage in England, 1600 - 1800 by Lawrence Stone; Clarissa by Samuel Richardson and Fingersmith by Sarah Waters.

As well as discussing these books and what they mean to her, Hallie Rubenhold looks at the reaction to her bestselling The Five, including the trolling she’s received from Ripperologists, the need to tell lost women’s voices from history and gives a glimpse of the history behind the books that have shaped her

https://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/online-digital-collection,html_files\www_londonlibrary_co_uk_online_digital_collection.html,"As well as print copies, the Library subscribes to over 300 online versions of its journals, augmented with access to thousands more through online periodicals archive services such as JSTOR. For further details of the extensive range of periodicals and databases that can be accessed on-line see our eJournals pages. Much of the content of our eJournals is directly searchable through the Library’s online catalogue service CATALYST.

The majority of the Library’s electronic resources are provided through annual subscription rather than purchase and the continuation of each subscription depends on the volume of use and available funding. Wherever possible, licences are secured which permit use by members remotely (via the Library’s website) in addition to use on the Library’s premises. While some licences permit unlimited use, others are restricted to one or more simultaneous users; the use patterns of restricted licences are regularly reviewed and simultaneous use allowances expanded where demand requires and resources permit.

Academic resources

Through JSTOR you can access a huge digital library of academic journals, books, primary sources and periodicals. London Library membership provides free access to most of JSTOR's content, which subscribed to separately normally costs around £200 per annum.

Members also have access to a vast collection of historic research material through hundreds of publications including The Bibliography of British and Irish History, British History Online, the Proceedings of the Old Bailey 1674-1913, the Survey of London and The British Newspaper Archive, plus much more.

Newspaper archives and historic publications

As a London Library member you’ll be able to use the full digital archives of The Times, The Sunday Times, The Guardian, and The Observer, plus the extensive British Newspaper Archive,  the 17th-18th Century Burney Newspapers Collection and more!

This enormous range of archival material is perfect for researching from home - whether you’re working on an academic research project, writing a novel or working on your family history.

Our subscriptions to historic publications - such as the Illustrated London News and the Country Life archive - provide a wealth of information, much of it beautifully illustrated, that is ideal for both work and pleasure.

Literary resources

An extensive collection of literary journals and collections is available if you’re looking to stay in touch with the literary world. London Library membership gives access to titles such as the complete archive of The London Review of Books, New York Review of Books, English Poetry, The Complete Prose of T S Eliot archive, Early English Books Online and many more.

Art

Our online art resources offer a wealth of material for art researchers and art historians. As well as access to all of the art journals available  through JSTOR we also provide use of the International Bibliography of Art, Oxford Art Online and more.

Languages

The London Library’s language collection is extensive. Membership gives access to European language newspapers and publications such as Die Zeit/Literatur book reviews and Gallica: The digital library of the national library of France. We also offer Russian literature, language, history and art publications. 

Oxford English Dictionary

For access to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) eResources, please first sign in to Catalyst via The London Library website and scroll down to the OED link. Please contact the Library team should you need help.

 

We have now made our first foray into the expanding world of eBooks through OverDrive who offer a wide selection of fiction and non-fiction eBooks, and a range of audiobooks.

Browse The London Library on Overdrive 

Read Overdrive guidance

eBooks play an important role in the publishing world and a huge range of titles are available, whether as downloads onto existing computers/tablets or onto dedicated platforms such as Kindles. The Coronavirus lockdown restrictions have really reinforced their importance as an easy way of accessing content remotely.We have identified a number of titles that are in high demand in the Library and have purchased additional copies as eBooks. We have also purchased some fiction that we see circulating quite highly in the Library, such as books which have won awards of various kinds. Additionally, we have included a set of classics that are being made freely available by Duke Classics during the pandemic. Members can access our eBook selection either through the OverDrive website, or through an app called Libby. Members are welcome to make recommendations regarding new e-books for the Library to acquire from the entire OverDrive catalogue, similar to our book suggestions scheme. This can only be done via the OverDrive website, and not in the Libby app. Add the green text in both places.

Not all of the Library’s collections are included in our online catalogue but we have added all acquisitions since 1950 and a substantial and growing number of titles from our earlier catalogues as part of our Retrospective Cataloguing Project. 

As the range of humanities information sources available in digital format has expanded, the Library’s collecting remit has also expanded to encompass digital materials where these are relevant to the subjects covered by the printed collections. 

In developing our electronic resources, we give priority to acquisition areas where digital format:

It is our policy to defer exposure to digital (and other non-book) formats where:

Philanthropic support is at the heart of The London Library; from Royal Patron Prince Albert's £50 donation, TS Eliot's fundraising auction to save the Library from closure and, more recently, The Tom Stoppard Innovation Fund. The Library is defined by its independence and despite receiving no government or statutory funding, has remained self-financing throughout its history thanks to the generosity of many individuals. Please consider joining this group of generous supporters and help The London Library to flourish as an important literary hub.

Be part of the wonderful tradition of supporting one of the country’s great literary institutions, its independence and its contribution to culture, by becoming a Patron of The London Library.

We are looking for volunteers to help with the daily running of your Library, which helps keep this much needed community service open and running.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could initially commit to a weekly time slot for 4 weeks.  This way we can train you up in the relevant tasks and you can then assign yourself a time slot through the Volunteers Rota.  Such a commitment would not be needed for Meeting and Greeting roles.

We need volunteers to do the following:

Front Desk Role – issuing books and taking reservations and registering new members, answering phone calls and front of desk book queries.  This role is face to face with our members and might also involve re-shelving and maintaining the book stocks.  It would suit someone who is confident with computers.

Book Administration Role – It would suit someone who is confident with computers.

Meeters and Greeters – would suit someone who is not very confident with computers but would still like to help out.  We need volunteers who can direct customers to classes and events and answer general queries.

If you are interested in helping us during some of your free time please ring us on 020 7419 6599

We try to cover half of this by letting out rooms on the days that the library is closed and by running events. So, each year, we still have to raise the other £40,000 from donations and grants. That is where you all come in. 

Please help us continue our success, by…

We would like to thank our many generous donors, who keep this wonderful Primrose Hill Community Library going. If you have any questions, please contact Will Carnochan at financemanager@phcl.org or on the Library telephone number.

Mini Mozart is a fun filled interactive class sandwiching parachutes, props and bubbles with classical music and nursery rhymes. Each class is based on a different fable and will feature at least two live musicians.
The main difference between Mini Mozart and other music classes is that we only use Live Music and at least 2 musicians perform and interact with the children at every class.

 NO QUIBBLE GUARANTEE!  If Mini Mozart isn’t THE BEST thing you do with your little one all week (apart from snuggles – we can’t compete with that) we’ll give you your money back. Or if a nursery place comes up.  Or if you move.  Or if naptime changes.  No problem.

On Saturday 31 March 2012, Chalk Farm Library sadly closed its doors for the last time.  But on Saturday 28 April 2012, we re-opened as Primrose Hill Community Library.

We are a group of volunteers who came together to save our much-loved local library when it lost all public funding in 2011. We have been inspired by the strength and spirit of the community backing our efforts –  thanks to over 200 residents volunteering their time and 494 financial pledges totalling £593,000 we have taken over the building from Camden Council on a 20 year lease.

We’re excited about the future for the Primrose Hill Community Library but we all need to pull together to make it an inclusive, vibrant community space we can be proud of.

On Monday 22nd October 2012 at 7 pm we officially opened as Primrose Hill Community Library.

The ‘Piper of Oldfield’ played as the ribbon was cut by local boy Roman Haddon, one of the first children to receive a new Primrose Hill Community Library card. 

The library patron Joan Bakewell, Alan Bennett and Primrose Hill Community Association and Library Chair Maureen Betts all gave speeches in support of the library. Guests then tucked into a very yummy cake, donated by Primrose Hill Bakery, which featured the library logo, and canapes provided by the Princess of Wales.

The Primrose Hill Community Choir gave their first ever performance. It was a wonderful evening with wine, cake, singing and a bringing together of the local community.

More about the history of the campaign to save the Primrose Hill library here…

Redbridge Museum & Heritage Centre is the local museum and archive service for Redbridge.

The Museum explores the many different places, people and events in over 150,000 years of Redbridge history.

Since opening in 2000, the Museum has worked with hundreds of local people, produced more than 70 exhibitions and displays, attracted more than 200,000 visitors, held over 600 family activities and taught 33,518 school pupils.

Thanks to a £100,000 grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and funding from Arts Council England, Art Fund and others, Redbridge Museum is having a brilliant refurbishment and is due to open later in 2023.

This is an exciting opportunity to revamp the Museum's much-loved permanent exhibition.

We will let you know when it's reopened and what brilliant exhibitions are planned. 

You can still visit Redbridge Myseum's website to find out more about what they do.

Redbridge Museum has a busy programme of exhibitions and projects involving local communities.

The RHS supports community groups, including Britain in Bloom and It’s Your Neighbourhood participants, gardening clubs and other horticultural societies (‘Affiliated Societies’) and other organisations in a wide range of horticultural activities. The RHS provides support through providing information, advice and benefits, including magazines, free annual group visits to RHS Gardens and access to affordable insurance for gardening equipment and activities. In doing so, the RHS relies on its legitimate interests in promoting and facilitating gardening in communities.The RHS also provides opportunities to these groups, and organisations, to apply for RHS grants to fund and support their gardening or other horticulture projects.For the above purposes, the RHS will collect the following personal data about the groups’ main contact:

The RHS works with schools, groups and individuals to promote gardening for young people. We collect contact details to administer Campaigning for School Gardening (CFSG) membership and our legal basis for this processing is our CFSG membership terms and conditions, agreed when registering. We do not collect any children’s personal data for CFSG membership.As a CFSG member we collect the following information about you:

CFSG provides information, advice and benefits which include newsletters, competitions, information about our training courses and school gardening awards.You can change your preferences at any time by contacting us on [email protected].

We will always provide you with an option to unsubscribe in every marketing email that we send you.

While children have the same rights as adults over their personal data, we take particular care when processing children’s personal data, following data protection principles and with a particular emphasis on fairness in processing.In running some of our activities or special events (such as the Santa’s Grotto held at the Gardens) we may collect personal data from or about children and for this, we rely on parental consent where at all possible. We only retain children’s personal data for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes required.For our annual School Gardeners of the Year Competition, we collect children’s personal data on those nominated by schools or groups for consideration. The children shortlisted are promoted on the website. Details of those not shortlisted are deleted.For the above purpose we collect the following personal data of the children entering the competition:

Where we use children’s images it is our policy to collect a signed model release form which records parental/guardian consent.

We protect these as personal data. We collect these, and also permit some of our service providers to do so, in the following circumstances: 

Occasionally we use remote controlled drones with cameras. When drones are in use, we will let those in the vicinity know with signs and you will be able to see the marked drone operator to allow you to avoid the area if you do not want to be inadvertently filmed.

We are making lots of improvements at our gardens and are filming in and around these sites to capture the developments through time lapse photography and video. While it will likely not be possible to identify individuals in the finished time-lapse clips, individuals may be identifiable in the original footage and images. We will keep the original footage secure. We have viewing platforms allowing our garden visitors to safely look at the work on development sites. Our visitors may take images of the site for personal use and we also take images and video records of the work for our records.

We use CCTV at all gardens, sites and most Flower Shows to prevent and detect crime and for health and safety reasons. CCTV relies on strategic placement of cameras. We periodically monitor the camera's footage and recorded footage for specific purposes and limited period. You will be able to see our cameras and we have RHS CCTV signs displayed in the areas in which we use them.

We collect information from social media sites if you have given us permission to do so or if you interact with us on one of our social media pages (for example, by liking or sharing Our Facebook page or posting a comment).

As a Charity, fundraising is a key part of our work to support our charitable work and vision, and we are committed to working in a transparent, ethical, responsible and honest way. To reflect this commitment, we are a member of the Fundraising Regulator and committed to the Regulator’s Code of Practice.We conduct research using information from publicly available sources such as professional profiles (for example, corporate biographies and/or LinkedIn profiles); search engine and public social media results; media, news; other resources such as Companies House and the Charity Commission; and publications such as Debrett's, Who’s Who and the Sunday Times Rich List to profile and better understand a small minority of RHS members, supporters, or prospective supporters, who may be interested in supporting our charitable work. Where we do this, we use the publicly available information to review financial, philanthropic and professional information of supporters or prospective supporters. We will only use limited necessary information required in order for the review.In some cases, we will obtain potential indicators of interest or financial status based on postcodes. This information is not specific to the individual but will indicate probable characteristics based on postcode. We may use postcode analysis to send every postcode in an area special offers or invitations to events.This is known as profiling and our legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest to build a more personalised relationship by building a more detailed profile of RHS members, existing donors, prospective donors or supporters.Following the profiling, we may invite you to attend an RHS meeting or event. If we do, we may need to share some basic information about you with RHS advocates or trustees involved in the fundraising meetings and events, for the purposes of focusing conversations we have with you about fundraising in the most effective way and ensure that we provide you with an experience which is appropriate for you. It is only shared with those who need to know the information at the time of the meeting or event.The RHS does not carry out profiling that has any significant legal effect on you. If we think that any profiling activities that we carry out may have a significant legal effect, then we will ask for your consent to ensure you are informed and have control.We do not use profiling on children or use special categories such as; racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or health data for profiling.You have the right to object to this profiling.

The RHS carries out research to test and improve services.

We need information about you when inviting you to take part in research to ensure that:

Survey Monkey is used on behalf of the RHS to collect this data.Not everyone who fills in the survey will take part in the user research sessions. People will be selected by the answers given in any surveys we may ask to fill in prior to interviews and hit our research brief. 

We need to collect data during the research session to ensure that we have an accurate record of what happened and what was said. This is important, because we then analyse this information and use it to draw conclusions about what we should do next.

We use your data because you have consented for us to do so for this particular piece of research. 

When inviting you to take part

The personal data we collect from you at this stage could include information about your:

name

age range

gender 

ethnicity (do we need to ask this?)

disabilities, such as details of any condition that can affect your ability to use a computer 

email address

We may collect additional information, based on the specific topic being researched. For example, if we’re conducting research on a specific RHS service, we might want to know whether you’ve used this service in the past.We sometimes work with other organisations to carry out research. This can include companies that help us recruit people to take part in research. We will always ensure that we have a contract in place with the organisations. If we do this, these companies may also collect additional data for which they are the data controller, and their privacy policy will also apply.

In most cases, we’ll collect personal data during the research session. This could be in the form of:

audio recordings

video recordings

screen recordings

written notes

photos

Survey questionnaire

 

We sometimes use external organisations to book a venue for the research outside of our offices, and external tools to conduct remote research sessions. This means that a limited number of staff in other organisations may have access to your data - for example, when we use the recording equipment at an external venue.We may also use the following third party tools and services to collect, transcribe or analyse your data:

survey tools

online collaboration tools, including video conference and virtual whiteboard tools

consent management tools

If we do any of the above, we will monitor and limit the access that people outside the RHS have to your data. The privacy policies of these external organisations will also apply.

When using your responses in reports or presentations, or sharing internally or externally, we will make sure you cannot be identified from your data. Each person taking part in a piece of research will be assigned a number, and any names or other personal and identifiable data will be removed.Only researchers working at the RHS will have access to the full original survey responses and recordings though we may share short audio or video clips with external organisations who are contracted to work on the research.If we do any of the above, we will monitor and limit the access that people outside the RHS have to your data. The privacy policies of these external organisations will also apply.

sell or rent any of your data to third parties

share your data with third parties for marketing purposes

After this point, we will delete this but will keep a record of consent, your name, and the data gathered during the research session.We will hold the data from research sessions, your name, and a record of consent for a maximum of 3 years.

You have the right to withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data - for example original recordings and notes where you can be identified. If a report with anonymised quotes has been published (internally or externally) we will not be able to remove this as it does not constitute personal data.You also have the right to request:

We only offer a concessionary Life membership for those over the age of 60, we do not offer
                            concessionary rates on standard memberships, but our aim is to keep membership prices as low as
                            possible for all.

Membership donations are critically important to the RHS because we are engaging in more work now
                            than at any time in our 200-year history. As a registered charity that receives no Government
                            funding, membership brings in much-needed income to help secure gardens and gardening, and advance
                            our charitable objectives. Our objectives include growing our RHS Campaign for School Gardening,
                            engaging communities through Britain in Bloom, developing our RHS Gardens, furthering research into
                            pests and diseases affecting gardeners today and enabling members to share our vision ‘to enrich
                            everyone’s life through plants, as well as to make the UK a greener and more beautiful place’.

We use money from membership donations to help fund our charitable work. Together, we’ll be
                            helping millions of school children sow, grow and learn through our RHS Campaign for School
                            Gardening as well as inspiring communities right across Britain to get gardening.

Yes, you can choose to join at the garden entrance at all our gardens, please just ask a member of
                                staff. Alternatively, if you pay the normal entry fee at the main entrance, hold on to your receipt
                                and if you take out individual or joint membership as you leave the garden you can exchange up to a
                                maximum of two garden entrance tickets per membership on the day of your visit.

Yes, we offer free entry for essential carers accompanying visitors with a disability, when you visit
                                one of the main RHS Gardens - Wisley in Surrey, Hyde Hall in Essex, Rosemoor in Devon, Harlow Carr
                                in Yorkshire and Bridgewater in Greater Manchester. If your membership has a guest entitlement you
                                can still use this in addition to your carer.

We have more than 220 RHS Partner Gardens and carer arrangements can vary - please check before
                                visiting, details can be found in your membership handbook or by visiting our RHS Partner Gardens
                                page.

If you have joined by direct debit, or via this page, it takes up to 48 hours for your membership to
                                be recognised with our online booking system.

Alternatively, you can buy an RHS Shows ticket and membership package at the same time by selecting
                                the ‘join today’ option when visiting our official RHS ticketing site.

Please note: You should only select this option if you are buying a membership and ticket together.
                                If you are already a member, please log in (after 48 hours for new members) to access member rates.
                            

By buying RHS membership you’re supporting our charitable work to train the next generation of gardeners,
                to find solutions to environmental issues and to inspire everyone to grow. Thank you!

Science for gardening is at the heart of the RHS as we lead research into today's many challenges
                                    in horticultural science, including climate change and plant diseases.

The RHS aims to share practical knowledge and inspire people of all ages and abilities with an
                                    interest in plants and gardening, growing the next generation of horticulturists.

Among our community projects are RHS Britain in Bloom and RHS Greening Grey Britain, transforming
                                    communal spaces into green places.

Local Studies is open for drop-ins at the following times:

It is possible to visit on a Tuesday to Friday morning by appointment. Contact us before your visit:

If the appointment has not been confirmed by staff, it will not be possible to visit that morning.

We encourage visitors to let us know what day they plan to visit and what collection items they would like to consult or what information they are trying to find. This allows us to get out documents in advance, meaning that visitors spend less time waiting during their visit.

Local Studies is at the top of the building. Take the stairs or the lift to the second floor and from there take one more flight of stairs up to Local Studies. On arrival you will be greeted by Local Studies staff.

Local Studies is a pencil-only environment, and pens are not allowed. Bring with you any pencils and paper that you will need.

It will be possible to bring a camera with you to take photographs of documents if you wish, although please be aware that there is a charge for this. Staff can advise you of the self-service photography charges before or during your visit. 

Please bring cash if you expect to take photographs of documents, or to request photocopies or scans. Card payments are not accepted.

All visitors to Local Studies are asked to place their coats and bags in a locker and to keep with them only those items that they need for their research. Locker keys can be collected from Local Studies staff. Please be aware that the lockers are small and cannot take large items.

Due to the fragile nature of the collection items, gloves must be worn if you have hand sanitiser or hand cream on your hands - gloves will be provided. If you have clean, dry hands washed with soap and water, gloves aren't required except when handling specific collection items - staff will advise when gloves are necessary.

If you would like staff to make photocopies or scans of any of the documents provided to you during your visit, or if you would like to take photographs with your own device, please be aware that there are charges for this. Staff can advise you of the charges before or during your visit.

We are unable to take card payments at Local Studies and can only accept payment by cash or cheque.

There are no cafes or refreshment areas in the building. Food and drink cannot be consumed on the premises.

Access to Local Studies is not step-free. If you require step-free access, let us know in advance of your visit and we will arrange for your visit to take place in a part of the building that is step free.

Accessibility information for the Old Town Hall is available on the AcessAble website.

If you have any questions about accessibility, please contact us to discuss.

Returning in September 2024, the Know Your Place heritage festival will once again showcase the people and places that have shaped the vibrant cultural borough you can see today.  

Through a carefully curated programme of events, exhibitions, talks, walks, tours, and workshops, the festival has celebrated and engaged residents and visitors with the borough's rich local history for over a decade. 

The Local Studies Collection provides access to material relating to the history of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It contains the collections previously held by the former boroughs of Barnes, Richmond and Twickenham.

With our online catalogue you can search thousands of records from the archives of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, covering Barnes, East Sheen, Ham, Hampton, Hampton Hill, Hampton Wick, Kew, Mortlake, Petersham, Richmond, Teddington, Twickenham and Whitton.

Cataloguing work is ongoing, and we are regularly updating the database. If you cannot find what you are looking for you can contact us.

The catalogue includes a large collection of building plans which have been catalogued and scanned with funding provided by HLF.

Most of the borough's moving image collections are looked after by London's Screen Archives, and many of the films can be watched online. 

Many people are interested in their family history. There are several places where you can find out information, and there are many useful links to external websites.

Local Studies is putting out a call for diaries written by residents in this unusual time.

Put your best foot forward and learn more about the history of Richmond upon Thames with our fascinating health walks.

The Local Studies team publishes some of its local history notes about people and places in the borough online. There is also a set of illustrated timelines:

Amongst our online reference services, Richmond Libraries also has a subscription to Ancestry Library Edition, the leading family history website. Please note that this can only be used on library premises.

https://www.southchingfordlibrary.org.uk/information/volunteering,html_files\www_southchingfordlibrary_org_uk_information_volunteering.html,"In normal times, new volunteers are always welcome, to cover many and various duties, ranging from book reception, meet and greet, book sorting and arranging, to behind the scenes work concerned with library running and development.

We are usually also interested in recruiting (in the voluntary sense; you will not get paid!) people with special hobbies and interests, who are willing to start new groups to meet regulary in the library.

Now that we have re-opened post pandemic we hope to eventually return to opening five days per week. We offer the chance to meet an interesting and eclectic mix of local people, working with a common aim to benefit the South Chingford community,

If we have whetted your appetite, then please download a volunteer application form, and after completing, please bring it in to the library.

As we have been closed for so long, and to follow GDPR, we have decided to dispose of all existing volunteer records, and to effectively start again with all volunteers, past and new, completing new forms. Past volunteers will have some steps in the volunteer application process simplified. This will have the added benefit of refreshing our volunteer data.

https://www.southchingfordlibrary.org.uk/about-us/the-beginning,html_files\www_southchingfordlibrary_org_uk_about_us_the_beginning.html,"The South Chingford Community Library came into existence in the Spring of Olympic Year 2012. 

In 2011, Waltham Forest Council was tasked with making major budget savings over the following years. As part of these, the South Chingford Branch Library, used by local residents over many years, was scheduled for closure. 

During the summer of 2011, a petition was raised against the library closure. More significantly, library visitors were canvassed on their willingness to volunteer to run a replacement community library. This action was spearheaded by Councillor Jemma Hemsted of Valley Ward. Closure was confirmed later in the year, and the old library closed its doors to the public for the final time on Friday 2nd December. A meeting took place at Waltham Forest Town Hall on the following Monday, with councillors and potential volunteers in attendance, where brave volunteers first stepped forward to form a steering group to begin planning the Community Library.

 The former South Chingford Branch Library

A major consideration was finding a suitable site for such an enterprise. By coincidence, a further aspect of  of the financial savings was the closure at the end of the summer of the Waltham Forest Direct shop at 265 Chingford Mount Road, just around the corner from the old library, but in a much more central position for passing shoppers. The Council kindly made this building available for the new library. Members of the local community with longer memories will recall this as the site of Rossi's Ice Cream shop, a delightful establishment which had a counter which served directly to the passing public on the pavement, and which also had a wide variety of toys on offer when you ventured inside.



 Shopfront of the new South Chingford Community Library

I believe the tiled area of pavement outside the shop may be the last remaining legacy of Rossi's. Sadly, no ice cream remains.

 The early part of 2012 was a period of feverish activity, preparing for a scheduled opening in April. The visual signs of this were the appearance in the new library of equipment and furniture (much of this also kindly provided by the Council), including shelving from the old library, computers, and some 8000 books.  We are also grateful for funding provided from Valley and Larkswood Wards to defray the initial expenses. Some of us learnt new skills, like book sorting and arranging.  Behind the scenes, much planning was also taking place. We are particularly grateful to Bettina Aruoture of the Council's Community Engagement Team, for her continued efforts and advice in all matters associated with the our interaction with the Council, which are ongoing from the very start of the creation of the new library.

Finally, on Saturday April 14th 2012, opening day arrived!

Opening Day

 The weather was kind, and a packed expectant crowd gathered inside the library to await the arrival of our invited guests. Among the special guests we were pleased to welcome in the morning  were our local MP, the Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,  the (then) Mayor of Waltham Forest, Councillor Geoffrey Walker, with deputy Mayoress Patricia Arnold, and  Naomi Newstead, candidate in the upcoming London Assembly election. We were delighted also to see Bettina, Jemma, and her colleagues Councillor Michael Lewis from Chingford Green Ward, Councillor Peter Herrington from Endlebury Ward, and Councillor Nick Buckmaster from Larkswood Ward.

A flavour of the days events may be gleaned from a series of pictures:

Fortunately, some of the volunteers can already read 

and on this one occasion, we even got fed! 

Jemma, Naomi, and Iain Duncan Smith explore the facilities of the community library 

Iain Duncan Smith visited reception and signed the visitors book before departure

Following events of the morning, there was a brief lull in proceedings, allowing volunteers and visitors alike to catch their breath, before excitement built once more, in anticipation of the arrival of our final special guest; Boris Johnson, Mayor of London. Events continued as follows:



Greg greets Boris at the Library entrance 

and proceeds to describe how the library has been set up We all enjoyed Boris's visit - he showed great interest and was very encouraging 

before leaving, Boris signed our Visitors' Book and promised us a donation of books 

and so the day ended, and we could wish our guests farewell

I think all who attended the day will agree that it was a great success, and an enjoyable time was had by all. The purpose of formally declaring the library open was well and truly achieved.

https://www.southchingfordlibrary.org.uk/about-us/testimonials,html_files\www_southchingfordlibrary_org_uk_about_us_testimonials.html,"From Sir Iain Duncan Smith, patron of SCCL “I am enormously proud to have been asked to be a patron of the South Chingford Community Library. As the Member of Parliament for Chingford and Woodford Green, I have seen firsthand the incredible asset this community library has become since the closure of the original library and its move to its present site (265 Chingford Mount Road) right in the heart of the community. The library is run by volunteers for residents and often many community groups use the library to meet and do diverse activities such as knitting.  It is not just a library, but it is also a place where people of all ages can visit and be part of that community. It is a vital asset for the community, and I pledge myself to campaign to keep the library there and support it by the local council as well.”

From Jemma, Conservative Councillor for Valley Ward, without whose efforts over a decade ago, SCCL might never have been born “The SCCL is a registered charity and a hub of activity with well over 2k members.  SCCL is more than just a library, as well as lending books they have helped an enormous amount of people, both young and old, with reading skills, cv writing, language & computer skills.  As well as offering and giving assistance with accessing Council services. They offer lots of activity groups like knitting, poetry, Christmas parties and quiz events which not only help with their fundraising but brings the community together and brings people out of social isolation.  All of which we know helps bring down Council costs. They also offer themselves as a safe & warm space in the coldest of months and as a cool space in the hottest. They have even been utilised by other charities such as Age UK and Diabetes Action as well as regularly hosting ward forums & surgeries for local councillors.  The local safer neighbourhood policing teams also hold regular surgeries in their premises.  Please note that if the SCCL were to close then there would be no suitable venue for any of these purposes which would be catastrophic for community engagement.”Kath who runs Rhyme Time says “We have been running rhyme time for almost a year. It took a short time for word to spread but we now have our regular visitors. We usually average 10- 12 children, but also get occasional visits to our session from a local nursery, with an additional 8-12 children. It is great to hear the carers giving advice to anyone worried about their child. We have one Mum who has been coming since her son was a new born and it is wonderful watching him grow, with his interest in what is going on at rhyme time constantly increasing. There doesn't seem to be very much available in the immediate area for carers of small children and they have been able to chat with each other and advise on any other local suitable activities. I feel we provide a valuable service enabling carers and children to enjoy each others company in a safe and happy environment.” 

From Jean who has run the knitting groups since the first year: Twelve years ago I couldn’t find my perfect knitting group, so I decided to form my own. It had to be local as there were none in South Chingford, held every week in the daytime , welcome everyone , cost nothing per session  ( though over the years we have given the library about an average of £1000 a year)and members make their own rules by majority vote. The Community Library was just starting to open new days. We were welcomed in and the Knit and Natter group has continued to flourish, adding in a Saturday group , Sit and Knit after a year or so. From the original 15 members weekly attendance has varied between that and 20, including all nationalities, ages, language speakers and abilities. As we are totally visible to passers by over the years we have had so many donations that we can offer members free needles, yarn , patterns, buttons and other knitting items The benefits to our members are many ,not just improving skills. We have become a family supporting each other as families do , through life’s problems , loneliness, ill health and even death( of  partners and members themselves). A lot of us rely on the group to give us a purpose in life. Over my time as a member of South Chingford Community Library I have been a Trustee as well as a volunteer. Organised sales , Quiz Nights , buy supplies of equipment , the Twixmas parties and Macmillan fund raising Tea parties. Every Christmas , instead of giving everyone a card I knit or sew them a little present . I am certain South Chingford would be a very dull place if the library did not exist”  Message from Isabella who runs  the Monday afternoon craft group: “I just feel we are not just a Craft Group but we are also contributing to the community by making twiddle muffs which we donate to Walthamstow Forest Dementia Hub and a Clinic in Hawkwell CT. We are also making scarves and fingerless gloves which we will be donating to Heavitree Court/House.”

From our oldest volunteer Marie (91 years old) “I have been volunteering at the library since the end of 2021. For me personally, the library has been incredibly helpful after losing my husband at the end of that year. It has given me a sense of purpose, an extended family, an amazing support group. The library is such a welcoming place to everyone that needs it, whether it’s staff or general public that needs help and this makes it a necessity to the community. Within the library we hold different groups and activities such as rhyme time, craft afternoons, knitting groups and poetry afternoons. These help create a safe space for some, a place where mums are happy to bring their babies, a fun and social environment for others, and just a general sense of community amongst everyone. For the people that work”

Below you can see Marie in action!   

From Shashi who runs the weekly police surgery: “Valley Safer Neighbourhood Team have been using the South Chingford Community Library-SCCL as their venue to conduct/schedule Police Surgery for the many years as a meeting point for the local Community Residents to assist and report any Police matters/issues. Over the years Local Police Team have engaged with the Community Residents who found it useful to be able to talk to the Police face to face either about Police Matters or just a chat over a coffee. The Library was the central Hub to the community of being on the main street-Chingford Mount Road E4 with access to the buses nearby who were able to come along and sit down and have a chat over a hot drink or use the facility such as access to the reading, computers, printing and so on. It will be a such a loss to the Community Residents to lose the Library as it provides a place to go and see/talk to other MOP  as well as all the dedicated volunteers who give up their valuable time to assist and make a little difference in people lives. Hope the Council can see how valuable the Library is for the Local Community and stays OPEN.”

From Emma in “Steps into Work”: “My name is Emma Kempster and I work for the London Borough of Waltham Forest in the Employment team. My job is to support the most vulnerable in Chingford.  There are a few locations within Chingford, but they are inaccessible to residents who are in need of employment support.  Since the government drive to get people with disabilities back into employment the Chingford residents require a service locally and the need is greater than ever, the residents we see at South Chingford community library have no other venue to attend locally many of whom are unable to use public transport or have severe mobility issues alongside Anxiety of leaving their local community . We have worked with South Chingford community library over a number of years and every year has been more beneficial than the previous year. We have an outstanding footall and a great network of professionals who are currently using the location as a base on a weekly basis to see some of their most vulnerable clients such as social services, adult early help, the early help team and many other advisors, who all provide vulnerable residents a statutory service for support that they need, so that they can develop confidence and progress with their journey back into employment .

The location is vital for my continued success and for the local residents, again unless we keep SCCL we will have no other location to work from which will impact on the council’s outcome delivery and the ability to provide a streamlined service across the borough as stated in the recent development plans of North of the borough (Chingford).”

 

From Jan CO chair of the LoveSouthChingford Group “South Chingford Community Library is far more than just a library!   This Library has been running since the original one closed and has been a vital part of our community ever since.  It’s been a first port of call for many needing help or just to pass the time of day with someone, possibly the only people they interact with. The computers are available to all ages and are a major part of the library which are used for tasks including homework, CV’s, research, printing and much more. They also hold several classes including rhyme time for the little ones, crafting, knitting, poetry reading, Valley Ward meetings and several more at various times, which all give value to the community and the wellbeing of it’s users.  To remove the library would adversely affect its residents and the area as a whole and without it these vital services would not be available to those who need it.”

From Veronika, one of our younger volunteers “I am actively volunteering for the South Chingford Community Library on Saturdays, because I have a full time job from Monday to Friday. I started volunteering there in January 2023, and it's been an absolute pleasure doing such a wonderful and meaningful thing for the local community. I met really decent, intelligent, dedicated volunteers who are willing to help and support anyone. The library itself has a wide variety of books on different topics, from children's books to adult fiction, crime, romance, cook books or DIY. We also offer services for every generation such as rhyme time for children and craft group and knitting group for adults. Everyone is welcome there; it's a safe space and friendly environment. It's always busy, we have a lot of customers coming in and buying books. It'd be a shame to close it down; the entire community would lose a precious little place, the last one around the Chingford Mount area.”

From Mahnaz who runs The Discovery Space ""SCCL - The library/community hub has been a vital resource for our community. An open and welcoming space where people can walk in, have a chat, attend free sessions (knitting, language, poetry, craft classes, etc). The beauty of the space is that it is literally run by the community and local residents for the wider community. All volunteers gain something from it - as do the service users. A real warm community space.   I have been using SCCL since we moved into the area. My daughter has really enjoyed reading books there over the past 8 years and we often pop in when we are in the Mount. We have attended the Twixmas and quiz events there - my husband ran a quiz night there too.   I also run the Discovery Space there which has been created to support people with their mental health through the art of coaching. The venue is conducive for this work as it is open to all. We often get passers by walk in and join as they see smiling faces when they look through the large windows where we sit. It’s the perfect location for what the Discovery Space is about! Our community."" From Aamina Khazna, EYFS Phase Leader, Subject skills coordinator , Chase Lane Primary School & Nursery Unit ""Over the past 10 years, our walks to the community library have been an important part in nurturing a love for books amongst our nursery children. Beyond books, it has been a gateway to our community, where we have met and interacted with library members and developed social skills. The library’s presence has not only enriched our children’s lives but also encouraged families to explore the library, strengthening bonds and community involvement. Its potential closure would be a devastating loss, not only would it deprive our children of invaluable learning experiences but also fracture an important and valuable part of our community.""

From Letitia & Mabel, Managers, Hearts Day Nursery We are saddened to hear the news about a possible closure of our favourite library, South Chingford Community Library. Our children love this library, we visit it every week and they request us to visit it as often as possible. We appreciate the effort of all the staff here and our children's learning and development would surely be affected if it had not been for this amazing library in our neighbourhood.  The library is definitely a great asset to our community and we will be doing our best to see it grow and used by many young generations!  We wish our Library and the staff  the very best of luck! Please let us know how we can support you.

 

An SCCL  member; Amanda & the Grigorescu family (the Beast Quest fans!) “Twelve years ago, when I came to live in the UK, the South Chingford Community Library represented my first step towards integration, the place where I went to practice the English language (inside an ESOL Conversation Club, which welcomed my children as well), where I made my first friends, where we organized charitable events and gathered the courage to read our first English books. Later on I would take a Spanish class at SCCL and introduce my children to their first book club and the amazing items created by the local knitting club. They still visit the library regularly and regard it as a cozy, friendly and inclusive environment, where they can chat with the amazing volunteers and discover a new magical world in each book they read. Our local community needs this welcoming spot!”

From Michael Parkes, who attends the library with his son David. “I’m writing on behalf of the South Chingford Community Library as a service user. I have used the library for nearly eight years and have found it to be a welcoming place. The staff there are helpful and always go beyond their duties. They make notes of authors to see if they can find them in the upstairs bookstore or elsewhere. I’m a Jo Nesbo fan and I acquired several of his books from there. A staff member even saved some Jo Nesbo books as he knew I wanted them. There’s a selection of newspapers and the odd tea or coffee too. The library is multifunctional and acts like a community centre that hosts clubs, meetings, parties, where people are welcome to share ideas or just have a natter. The fact that the library is so popular highlights the need for it in the community; where else would the poetry group, the knitting groups, the discussions on the latest books be had? There is a library in North Chingford , but that’s quite a way to go for the local elderly. I also like the fact that talking is allowed in the library, if a little too loud sometimes though. I take my son to the library and he likes to read, when I can get him to sit long enough. He liked to lounge on the bean bags with picture books, now more word books as his vocabulary is growing. It is also a centre for learning and runs language courses and IT basic learning courses. I will continue to support the library, as I know the good work that is done there.

From the owner of the property “As the landlord and previous owner of Rossi’s, a business serving the local community for many years in these premises, I see SCCL as taking up the baton where the local council stopped, after the closure of the main library. The volunteer run centre provides a much-needed library and community hub. This follows on a tradition that Rossi’s offered, a business that successfully provided a much-loved service to the local community. The fact that SCCL running costs compared to a commercial run library is far lower should be applauded and encouraged by the local council. Closure of such a well-run community asset would be a great loss.

However, the Thursday morning working parties continued, as did the Thursday afternoon Valley Ward community police surgeries on selected Thursdays. At the working parties, we continued to issue Covid test kits on behalf of the council. The council also asked us to issue scarves and gloves to those in need of them during the cold winter weather. The next development was the restarting of the Valley Ward councillor surgeries on Saturday mornings.

Dates for the Councillor Surgeries for the first 3 months



An online consultation into the council's plans to regenerate the Chingford Mount Area carried over from November into the New Year, with residents invited to provide their comments.



Boards were created to illustrate these initial plans in some detail. These boards were displayed in local shop windows to allow local residents to view them. From 10th to the 17th January, there were on display in the library window, as shown above.

This stage of the consultation is now closed, and the next stage will take place later this year. You can read further details here





Now three poems have been received from South Wales and added to the South Chingford Poetry Blog. You can read the latest one here.

LIBRARY RE-OPENING!

We are pleased to report that, following the fixing of a failed rear shutter, the library re-opened to the public, after having been closed for a little over two years, on Thursday 31st March.

The most exciting event of the year was our first opening in over two and  half years on 31st March, a very much delayed re-opening post covid as a result of various events.

2021

The library was invited to be involved in the planning of the ""Treasures of Chingford Mount"", an interactive trail around the places of interest in the Chingford Mount Area. We agreed with others that the little Art Deco architecture still remaining should be the basis for the logo of the event.

Steps into Work

The WF council's ""Steps into Work"" team has again been operating in the library on Fridays throughout the year, assisting people from the borough with getting back into paid employment. A small event was held on 20th December, when volunteers came to enjoy refreshments during the session:

The Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal

As usual, our volunteers were collecting outside the library, The final total raised was £1081.20. A big thank-you is due to all who purchased a poppy to contribute to this worthy cause!

The Black History Trail has started at Chingford Mount

The trail is running for the second year, celebrating the contribution of black people to society. This year's theme is ""Young, Gifted, and Black"". To participate, pick up a leaflet from the library entrance, which details the shops and businesses around Chingford Mount, including the library, which are participating. Each shop or business shows a picture of a young black person, together with a letter. Collect all the letters and solve the puzzle, then drop your solution into the library for a chance to win a prize.

Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, MBE features in the library. She was raised in Walthamstow, a maths prodigy, being the youngest person to be awarded a masters degree (at 19) in Maths and Computer Science, at Oxford. She was awarded the MBE in 2017 for her work with her social enterprise STEMettes, inspiring young women into careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM). 

Anne-Marie appeared on the final episode of ""The Apprentice"" on 18th December, advising the losing finalist Scarlett Allen-Horton on her plan to run an employment agency for executives in the engineering industry, specialising in female recruitment.

  

Others featured on the trail include actors Michaela Coel and Daniel Kaluuya, celebrated cellist Sheku Kanney-Mason, beauty blogger/vlogger Patricia Bright, rappers Akala and Dave, and from the world of sport Eniola Aluko, Raheem Stirling, Jofra Archer, and Dina Asher-Smith.

NCS Challenge Project for Young People - two projects in the library this year

NCS (National Citizen Service) is an opportunity for young people to develop new skills by volunteering. The library successfully took part in this last year for the first time (read the report). This year, we have two projects; the first principally concerned with book management within the library, and the second, with organising events for children, to run in the library on Monday August 1st.

The dates are:

Induction for Project 1:   Saturday 9th July   1-30PM - 3PM

Project 1 Action Day:       Sunday 17th July   11AM - 4PM

Induction for Project 2:   Monday 25th July

Project 2 Action Day:       Monday 1st August  11 AM - 4PM

The members from Project 1 will also be having a Social Action day on Monday 18th July,when they will be in and around the library, distributing fliers that they have produced, as well as cup-cakes, and also promoting the sale of children's books. So please come along and give them your support!

As part of the challenge projects in Waltham Forest, the volunteers also entered a Dragons Den on Saturday 16th July at Waltham Forest College. Copy kindly supplied by Roy appears below:

""Sue Brown and Roy Sutcliffe are dragons, at least in the context of being in a Dragons’ Den for the National Citizens’ Service Challenge programme.  They sat as a panel of four dragons, which also included Councillor John Moss, to hear presentations from five of the teams participating in this year’s challenge in Waltham Forest.  Each team was presenting its project and pitching for £50 to help them complete it.  As dragons they were able to question the teams about their projects, prepare feedback on the presentations for the programme management and decide how much of the funds available should be awarded to each team.  The presentations as a whole and the young people were impressive, and some teams were particularly outstanding in the level of professionalism they projected.""

Red Balloon Family Workshops for Children now extended

Following the success of the first workshops in May, the run has now been further extended to the end of 2016 during term times. Please see details below:

Here are three views from the Red Balloon Family activities towards the end of the year:

The  Challenge 2015

The National Citizen Service (NCS) ""Challenge"" is a project for young people to partake in events in the community. In 2015, such a project took place in the library, where a team of 12 motivated young people undertook a series of tasks to assist us. The team first visited during the day on Monday August 17th, to get an idea of what was required, and to meet volunteer staff from the library. The actual working day was Sunday 20th September, and three tasks were set. One sub-team was assigned to sorting out the books in the children's section, deciding which should be retained, and which to be disposed of, by means of sale to the public, A second sub-team was given the task of painting the front room above the library entrance, and the third sub-team sorted the upstairs book storage area, again deciding which books should be retained, and which should be disposed of. 

The young volunteers, were very polite, friendly, and extremely hard-working, and the day was most enjoyable for the library volunteers who attended. Some of us had difficulty understanding their conversations, coming from rather different generations. Two of us were rather fortunate to be treated to an impromptu performance of ""Wonderwall"", on acoustic guitar with vocals, which was an unexpected and very welcome bonus.

Amanda Sapio, Delivery Assistant Programme Manager from the NCS Kentish Town Office, who arranged the SCCL Challenge commented:

""NCS is an intensive, part residential programme for young people that takes place in the summer holidays as well as the February and Autumn half terms. Following an action-packed stay at an outdoor centre and a week spent learning a new skill in a tented village, participants develop a social action project to deal with an issue they care about and spend 30 hours putting their plan into action within their community. All 15 to 17 year olds across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are eligible to participate. Doing so costs £35-£50, and bursaries are available for low income families.

 

This year, The Challenge will work with over 650 schools and 2,000 business and community partners, employing over 2,500 staff to deliver NCS to 30,000 young people. Over 350 young people have taken part from Waltham Forest this summer. A team of twelve young people are working with South Chingford Community Library to help refurbish one of the upstairs rooms, along with sorting and cataloguing books as part of a volunteer day. The team are also running a campaign trying to engage young people using SCCL and are hoping to achieve £200 through fundraising. All our young people in Waltham Forest are working with community groups and charities based across the borough, all will complete a volunteer day along with campaigning on their partner’s behalf. 

 

NCS helps young people to develop important life skills, with participants reporting that the programme significantly boosts their confidence, leadership and team-working skills. It also benefits Waltham Forest by catalysing social action, creating jobs and building trust between young people from different backgrounds. One young person, Imaani described her visit with SCCL “The hospitality, consideration and utter love we experienced, truly opened my eyes to how important it is for young people to get involved in their community. If you want a positive change in your community, be that change”. ""

The Bingo Quiz

The bingo quiz was a great success, enjoyed by all, and raised £310 for library funds. Many thanks to Barbara, Marilyn, and their assistants, for organising and running the event.

The Bookmark Competition Results and Display

Following the judging and choice of winners by the judges, the bookmarks are now on display in the library.

We express our thanks to all the young people who entered the competition, the judges Mika Sembongi and Kate Wyatt for deciding the winners, and lastly (but certainly not least) to Zara, who organised the whole event.

Valley Ward Councillor Surgeries

From Saturday 4th July, Councillors Jemma Hemsted and Alan Siggers will be holding monthly surgeries in the library, on the first Saturday of each month, from 10-30 am until noon. Councillor Aktar Beg holds monthly surgeries on the third Saturday of each month, from 11 am until noon. So, if you live in Valley Ward and have local issues that you wish to discuss, then please come along.

The Bookmark Design Competition (this is now closed)

We have a bookmark design competition for children of all ages between 3 and 14. Entry forms may be picked up from reception in the library, or alternatively, you may download the form here. The bookmark may be designed using traditional hand-drawn techniques, or alternatively may be crafted digitally. In the latter case, you may wish to download a bookmark template. You can design using any theme you wish, but if you need a suggestion, then favourite books or characters is one idea.

The prize for the winner in each of the three age groups is an arts and craft set, and the competition closes at 4PM on Monday 13th July 2015.

Open Day - Saturday 11th April

The library celebrated its third anniversary with an open day on Saturday 11th April. Friends, members, volunteers, and representatives of associated organisations and regular users were present to add to the celebrations. These included Valley Ward Community police staff (together with mascot!), St. Edmunds Church, Age UK Waltham Forest, and Chingford Foundation Academies Trust, who also entertained us with singing in the afternoon. Regular groups including the Job Club , knitting groups, and the Spanish teacher, and a face painter were also in attendance, and the visitor numbers were approaching 200. Local councillors, and our MP, Iain Duncan Smith, who was also present on the opening day of the library on April 14th 2012, also attended. Thanks are due to Barbara and Marilyn, the principal organisers of the event, and all the volunteers who assisted, as well as the representatives of the organisations mentioned above, who all contributed to a very successful day. The slide show below gives a flavour of events on the day.

Annual General Meeting 2015

The 2015 AGM will be held in the library on Wednesday 13th May, beginning at 7pm. All members of the library are entitled to attend.

James Atherton's jumper

This story is especially for all fans of James Atherton, former star of ""Hollyoaks"", whose character Will Savage had a dramatic exit from the soap at the end of 2013. This year, James has been performing in a new award-winning play ""Crocodiles"", alongside Melanie Hill of ""Waterloo Road"" fame, at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, during the first half of October.

This is all very interesting, I sense you are thinking, but what has this got to do with SCCL?

Well, when theatre designer for the set of ""Crocodiles"", Sarah Beaton , needed a jumper knitted for James, she contacted Jean, who as you know runs the two knitting groups ""Knit and Natter"" on Thursdays and ""Sit and Knit"" on Saturdays. Jean accepted the commission, and the library benefitted to the tune of £20.

Here is James, playing the part of the son Vincent, wearing the jumper knitted by Jean (picture courtesy of Sarah Beaton).

The next James Bond film is scheduled for release towards the end of 2015. With luck, Daniel Craig may need a nice new knitted cardie.

The bingo quiz was a lot of fun and enjoyed by all. Enormous thanks go to volunteers Barbara, Marilyn, and Maurice for all their work in organising the event, which raised £500 in aid of library funds.

Thank you all for your support at the MacMillan coffee morning on Thursday 25th September. The final total raised was £206-12p. Especial thanks are due to Jean and her excellent team of cakemakers. 

Engaging with the community

On the 24th July, Sue, Jean, and Alan represented the library at a ""Step into Your Community"" event, organised by North East London NHS Foundation Trust (Waltham Forest).  The event targetted residents of the borough who have either direct or indirect experience of the effects of mental health. The aim was to increase their engagement with the local community, as experience suggests that increased social engagement is an important contributor to improving mental health.  

The event proved a great success for SCCL. Many visitors took information, and there were enquiries from potential new volunteers. The team also took the opportunity to meet other stakeholders and organisations represented there, with a view to setting up new partnerships and starting new initiatives to help the library develop further. 

Subsequently, on the 29th July, Sue attended a Job Fair with some regular members of the weekly job club from the library. This proved a useful opportunity for an update on the local job market, and the members returned with a list of vacancies to work on. 

Annual General Meeting

Approaching 30 members attended the 2014 Annual General Meeting on Wednesday 7th May at South Chingford Methodist church hall. The meeting was chaired by Susan Brown, in this new post, with new treasurer Stuart Manning, and secretary Narinder Matharoo, alongside.

Susan welcomed the attending members, and Narinder took the meeting through the minutes of the previous (first) AGM, with no matters arising. 

Susan then summarised the current healthy current position for the library, and recorded thanks to volunteers and the membership for making this possible. She then advised the need for major funding to cover the years ahead, and outlined the approach to generate this, via seeking partnerships and stakeholders, and approaching local businesses for sponsorship. She stressed that we can only seek funding for projects with clearly defined aims and objectives, with recorded outcomes, as opposed to just asking for money to cover expenses, and mentioned the official opening of the new IT facilities as a typical example of such a project (report appears below). 

                                                  Susan, Stuart, and Narinder at the top table 

Narinder confirmed to the meeting that we achieved charitable status on 11 September 2013, and displayed our certificate to the meeting.  He explained that our final constitution followed a format suggested by the charities commission, and differs significantly from the first one proposed. He pointed out that the constitution can be viewed in the library, and that a copy may also be downloaded from the website. He explained the role of the trustees, and their limited liability in the event that the charity is wound up.

The final constitution was approved unapposed.

Stuart stated that we have agreed funding of £14K which we can consider almost rubber-stamped, of which £11K is definite in the short term. This represents funds to run the library for two years. He reinforced the need for new projects to generate revenue. Very significant revenue this year has come from Jean's knitting groups (£1K), and also from book sales at £500. Stuart reported that the book revenue was generated before the price was reduced to 20p/book, and much higher book sale revenue is expected next year. A point to note is that once the lease is agreed and signed (covering the remaining seven years), the library becomes liable for paying utility bills (jn addition to the phone bill, at present). In response to a question from the floor, Stuart stated that current active membership is around 450 to 500, from a total value of about 700 if the lapsed members are included.

Stuart then went through the election of Trustees, covering proxy votes already received, plus votes from the membership in the hall. The following were elected:

Greg PopeSusan BrownNarinder MatharooStuart ManningRichard AshenDebbie BaldwinEarnest AfriyieJean CobbPeter Illes 

Because of our small size, there is no compulsion to appoint auditors, and it has been decided that we will audit the accounts ourselves.

With no further business to discuss, the meeting ended in a little over an hour.

Extending the range of newspapers and periodicals available in the library

A selection of recent periodicals and foreign language newspapers is now available for reading in the library, courtesy of Waltham Forest  Council Library Management, and the staff from Walthamstow and Hale End Libraries. These are updated on a regular basis.

Do come in to see what we have on offer. 

South Chingford Community Library needs your support

    

Over the past two years, SCCL has successfully provided library and community services that are used by members from all areas of Chingford, and beyond. We have over 700 members and about 60 active volunteers who give their services for free. We have received Waltham Forest Ward funding, but due to our success, the expansion of our opening hours, and increase in community activities, we now require more substantial funding to enable us to sustain the library and its services beyond 2014.

We have applied for Big Lottery and Comic Relief funding, but were not successful due to the nature of the library's business. We are now looking for a local sponsor or business who can either assist us financially or with advice on seeking funding.

If you can assist, then please contact us via social media or you can email us.

Thank You

Councillor Jemma Hemsted opens  the new ward-funded IT facilities at SCCL 

On Thursday 27th March, Councillor Jemma Hemsted of Valley Ward officially opened the upgraded IT suite in the library, which was financed by Valley Ward funding. The upgrade has enabled SCCL to increase the IT training sessions with Age UK. In attendance were Emma Tozer, Active Ageing and Volunteering Manager, Age UK Waltham Forest, Marilyn and Barbara : Team Leaders for Thursday sessions and lead contacts for Age UK silver surfers sessions, Peter, volunteer IT trainer for Age UK, Sue, SCCL Treasurer and Chair Elect, and seven people attending the silver surfer sessions.

Jemma commented “It was a pleasure to be asked to officially open the new IT facilities at the SCCL. It was great to see it being put to good use for the Silver Surfers Club.  All of the volunteers are doing a fantastic job in providing a much valued and needed community facility and, I am always more than happy to help whenever and wherever I can.“ 

                                              Marilyn, Peter, Barbara, and Emma with Jemma at the opening                  

 Emma said “Age UK Waltham Forest is pleased to work in partnership with South Chingford Library to provide beginners computer classes to Older Adults. The introduction of the new equipment means students who take part in the course are able to access the most up to date software. We are also working to expand our range of courses on offer to ensure older members of our community have access to a range of subjects and to different types of technology.”

On 6th June, our volunteer Keith Winch, together with sons Jeff and Dale, took part in a 10km charity run, to raise money for the Zoological Society of London (London Zoo) and also for the library. All three completed the run in 1 hour 2 minutes, and afterwards, Keith presented a cheque for about £40 to put towards library funds.

                                                        Well done Keith, Jeff, and Dale, and thank you!

Saturday morning College

Chingford Foundation School is running a Saturday morning  College covering varous arts and crafts subjects, and public speaking, for adults and students of various ages. The details are below:

Community library hosts an afternoon of fun and magic

South Chingford Community Library was again the venue for a Chingford Foundation School event on Saturday 16th March. Following a poetry evening just days earlier, Arts Award students doing their Social Enterprise Qualification staged an “Easter Egg-Stravaganza”. The students entertained a group of primary school children with a program which included card tricks, face-painting, portrait painting, card making, and cake decorating. The highlight was an Easter-egg hunt, which took the students to all corners of the library.

                   card tricks for the children                                                                                      face painting 

     announcing clue 1 for the Easter egg hunt                                                              cake decorating 

                 portrait painting                                                                                        organising the raffle

Proceeds from admission fees, sale of goods, and a raffle, were £45. All profits will be put towards the next Social Enterprise Qualification event which must also benefit the community.

 

Chingford Foundation School Arts Award fifth annual poetry evening

Tuesday 5th March saw the South Chingford Community library as the venue for its first public event; the Chingford Foundation School Arts Award fifth annual community poetry evening. Theme of the evening was “I have a dream”, to celebrate fifty years since the famous speech by Martin Luther King.

MC for the evening was local performance poet Neal Zetter, who entertained the packed library with a selection from his comic poems.

                               Neal Zetter performing to a packed audience in the South Chingford Community Library

The audience was principally made up of parents and children from local schools. These included Parkside Primary School (year 4 with their class teacher Mrs Pearce), Larkswood Primary School (year 6), Oak Hill Primary School, Chingford Foundation School, and Rushcroft Sports College. Via Chingford Foundation School's Arts Award supporter status, students from two schools from further afield were also present; Heathcote School and Havering Sixth Form College. A ladies writing group from Loughton was also represented.

Children and adults presented a variety of their own poems to an appreciative audience, and each received a signed certificate to commemorate the event. Not to be outdone, Alison Griffiths, job club coordinator from the community library, gave an impromptu performance of “The Owl and the Pussycat”.

Yolanda Guns, Arts Coordinator from Chingford Foundation School, who organised the event, also presented several poems.

After the event, Yolanda said “I'm really pleased that you were able to let us use the library for the Poetry Evening. I knew it would be the perfect venue and it was!”

The first AGM was held on Friday 31st May 2013 in South Chingford Methodist Church Hall. The meeting heard addresses from Chairman, Greg Pope, Secretary, Narinder Matharoo, and Treasurer Sue Brown.

Greg summarised the history and development of SCCL, and explained the concept of SCCL being more than just a book lending facility, but rather a hub for activities for the local community. He explained the continuing need to raise money, in particular to enable the upper floor to be refurbished, which will greatly increase the possible uses of the building. He reminded the meeting that our volunteer Keith Winch is running on Sunday 9th June to raise money for SCCL, and urged members to come into the library to pledge money for this. Further ideas for raising money were invited. He also emphasised the need for further volunteers so that opening hours can be extended to include Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, and also pointed out that we have a vacancy for a Health & Safety Officer.

Narinder explained the process we are engaged in to move towards charitable status, and explained that extra documents were requested during the application process. He estimated that maybe six weeks will elapse before the procedure is concluded. He summarised the contents of the SCCL constitution for the meeting. He also pointed out the need for a lease longer than 5 years being required when funding is being requested from external organisations.

The meeting voted to adopt the constitution.

Sue presented a verbal summary of the accounts, and explained that full details were available for inspection. She informed the meeting that the basic annual running cost for SCCL is about £17K.

Please note that the tour was produced some years ago, so details like some events and opening days have changed, but the tour still gives a good general idea of what SCCL looks like inside.

We wish to thank Jean Cobb for writing and producing the tour. This was truly a family production. Husband Alan was the cameraman, and the final version was completed by  son in law Paul, who edited the recording and added the music (which he both composed and performed himself!). Thank you all so much for your efforts in producing the tour, and thanks also to all the library regulars, users, and visitors, who appear.

 MIDNIGHT STAR

Last night I saw a midnight star  in Heaven's timeless spaceAnd I recalled those days gone by  of moments I'd retrace.

In deepest time within my mind  my memories brought delight,and - like that starshine in the sky -they lingered through the night.

  Just like an angel - as I slept - it watched me for a while,and when I woke at break of dawn  my star had left a smile.

  But as I gazed towards the skyt'was as I somehow feared...with morning light and sunshine brightmy star had disappeared.

  DEAR GRANDMA 

She sits alone, small and frail,childlike in an adult's chair.But there is life inside that wizened shell.Her heart and soul burn on untouched.               

🌺 But that soul cries to be free from strains of age;she's lived her life, why should she struggle on?                                         

🌺 But for me, I cannot be free, let go of ties that bind,of memories of those times gone bywhen I was young and small and weak,and it was she who cared for me.           Many years later, when with my baby boy I returned,great grandma was so proud.And just as if clocks had turned back in time,she rocked his cot and fed him by her hand.Full of love she bought him toys and proudly called him 'my little man'. 

🌺But as he took his first few steps, as he grew strong,her legs grew slow, she felt her age.And as once ago she'd led me by the hand,now I pushed young and old together in one chair....         

🌺The years soon passed by and too long I stayed away.When I returned my heart it shook, I felt the love that overwhelms,but most of all, my heart it cried for all it hadn't done. 

               Michelle Jamal

SOUTH CHINGFORD SPRING 2020

The line of senior stoics moves slowly past the treeswhose beauteous blossom white trembles gently in the breeze.Till eventually, bit by bit, the queue disperses in the store,while nearby 406 traffic thunders past with mighty roar.Once inside we quietly shop while warily keeping our distance,two metres it is, who can forget, but announcements give assistance.When on our daily walk, one is allowed, most roads are near deserted.Pedestrian crossings now redundant, no crowds, just people skirted.To keep apart, can walk in road, weeks ago, who knew?just cyclists, bird-song, lovely sun, and time to say “thank-you”.Then in the park, more runners now, they need to keep in trim.Ducks on the pond still come to me, thinking “what’s the matter with him?”Exercise equipment covered, sports areas locked or gated,just like for naughty children, whose toys are confiscated.Except for food and medical, most other shops aren’t open,for other things we buy online, our spirit is unbroken! Meanwhile, giant yellow crane on construction site stands tall,vertical and unmoving, signalling caution to us all.Despite it all, some good has come, so smile and don’t despair,new Skypers and Zoomers are appearing everywhere!With meetings virtual now the norm for people near and far,never again need for so much travel, just stay where you are!And new hero has appeared, the wonderful Captain Tom,whose efforts have inspired us all to boldly carry on.A library volunteer, I managed books and made the tea.Now I’m suddenly aware of others willingly helping me!Store staff, postmen, contractors, transport, these workers never flap,and, of course, NHS staff and carers, all merit a weekly clap!At last these stalwart workers are really in full favour,let’s hope, in future, respect remains, it really must not waver!We will survive this, most of us, the lucky ones, but keep in mindall those we’ve lost so tragically, and the grieving left behind.After cheering VE day, life begins to return again,let’s hope some peace enjoyed, kindness, and goodwill will remain.And as the giant yellow crane moves, like a signal turning green,we’ll slowly and uncertainly emerge to a different world never seen.

First pour Mum and Dad into a bowl,then stir in a few years,add birth, then leave to cool.Remove the infants after 4-5 years.Soon add school, teachers, and friends,laughter, fun, teamwork, and education,and leave to settle.

Mix family holidays, days out, and birthdays,plus a pinch of Christmas, and a touch of Easter.Add some drama, responsibility, and pain.Add some tears and change.Pour a tablespoon of new school.Sprinkle some fear, joy, and sadness.Heat it up and blend some friends and new faces.Add a 7, then replace it with an 8.Pour a Summer,then place it in the oven.Let the ingredients mix and combine.Serve with friendship,and enjoy.

THE JOURNEY OF THE CHING

The Ching is not a mighty river, indeed she’s rather smallbeing merely around 8 km in length from source to far outfall

She starts life as a dampish patch,  near pool that’s rather blackby Pear Tree Plain in Epping Forest close to the  Green Ride trackMere ditch at first, she travels Southish with no flowwith holly as a prickly friend, so small, she needs to growbefore wide hiatus comes to view, through the thinning treesa massive aneurysm!but this one’s good, it’s Connaught Waters, a delight for all to seeenjoyed by everyone, a favoured spot, for over a centuryCan walk all around, a new car park, ducks, geese, swans, and moorhensand often there’s an ice cream van, it’s crowded at weekends!She leaves at the south west corner, via grating that’s water shreddinga respectable size now, for Rangers road she’s heading.  Walkers, bikers, riders all cross the busy road just herewhile she passes demurely underneath close byon Chingford, Essex border on other side to appearOnce there, path passes stables, on very slight incline.She assumes meandering course here for first timein valley passing under forest canopy again.Then stays inside the trees, alongside Whitehall Plain

Crossing Whitehall Lane, her very best section now unfoldsA few hundred metres of twist and turns , with pleasure one beholdsbeloved of mountain bikers with ups and downs adjacent to her edgeKingfishers have been seen here, but new star I will pledgeis brilliant white Little Egret, a stunning little bird!As approach the Hatch some changes over the  yearsThe cheers have gone but,  old football ground appearsIt’s Newgate Street, in truth, no more than path or trackwhere Chingford Town FC  used to play way back in time,now new arched entrance to nowhere, behind barriers greenwhat has happening here, something  planners had not foreseen? Then roundabout, where once black horseless carriage stood resplendent in front of pub thus named. Then Wheelwrights, todaymodern flats replace, now just memory distantFor first time here she enters suburbia proper, Waterhall AvenueThen small wooded meanders below Chingford Glade, before throughby beautiful Higham’s Park Lake she flows quietly byAs though not wishing to upstage the tranquil scene we espyagain, there’s coots aplenty, and Canada geese, and gulls and swansA wonderful job done here to now restore bygones. Exit under Charter road, wide here, and flow on behind Gordon Ave, more speedThere’s green spaces here,  bridges, allotments, as Vincent Avenue’s accompanied with a wide green sward, past play area opposite Joseph Clarke school proceedswhere wonderful work is done for visually impaired and special needs.Cross Hale End Road, in scrub , behind Beech Hall crescent, she now passes under Beech Hall Road, quite pleasant to River walk, under railway bridge where we see unexpected sight,it’s Jane’s glorious barn owl mural clutching heart in splendid flight! behind Haldan and Cavendish roads she travels out of sight appears again crossing under Cavendish Path soon more changes come to lightIn days gone by, Stow greyhound stadium ahead we sawwhen Tuesday , Thursday, and Saturday evenings we heard some mighty roarnow gone, but  parts remain, tote building, white with famous  letters redand geyhound kennels, poignant reminder of former times. Now tastefully instead incorporated in  Stadium Place developed by L & Qa café shop, called Hugs with Mugs , where you can have a brewApartment groups with appropriate names, like Lingfield, Chesham, Goodwood debutand house groups  with names Norfolk, Brook, and Waltham too

How the world has changed!

In days gone by she misbehaved  on Chingford Road by stadium’s side, with flooded stream,but now she helps, accepts water, in revolutionary permavoid drainage scheme.Under Chingford Road, she enters now the supermarket section from Sainsbury’s to Morrisons, round here we need some action.She shares her bed with all sorts now, but really she’s not keenromantic or sexy it is not, more fifty shades of green!After Morrisons, it’s sort of purdah, her future’s now not greatas she’s lost to sight for quite a while  under Chingford Hall Estate

Then under North Circular, quietly out of sightWhile up above its constant noise of traffic day and night

Reappears with new look bestowed,  opposite  petrol station on Harbet RoadShe’s constrained by concrete corset now, all personality repressedit’s man’s fault that at this end her appearance is not the bestby Banbury reservoir in straight line channel for the final leg , no funBefore emptying into river Lea, her job now finally done.Her lifeblood at last is fully drained, maybe we should feel ashamed?Her contents discharged to the Lea, then Thames, and finally the sea.

She deserves cleaning up, no dumping ground, she’s suffering from  neglectO Chingford people, pray treat our little river with more respect! 

           Richard A. Ashen

Local artist Lasma Liepina was commissioned to create the large-scale artwork, History Made In Dulwich to transform the entrance of the library.

The piece is inspired by the nature, history and architecture of the area told through an intricate illustrated timeline from the year 967, when East Dulwich was a dill meadow through to the present day. It uses the historical reference, “967 Edgar the Peaceful granted Dilwihs to a thane” as a starting point.

Through research gathered at Southwark’s Archives and walks around the area, Lasma drew out elements of local history and architecture alongside everyday stories of people and places in the area.  Familiar buildings and infrastructure that have been part of everyday life in East Dulwich for centuries, such as St John's Church and its beautiful clock face, the railway, and city foxes are represented.

The Upper Norwood Library Hub (UNLH) sits on the cusp of 5 London Boroughs (Croydon, Lambeth, Bromley, Southwark and Lewisham). Our professional library service is delivered by Lambeth Council, co-funded by Croydon Council. We work in close partnership with library services, statutory and voluntary sector partners, connecting us to multiple communities and deeply rooting us into the heart of South London. Our library hub operates a co-created community programme focusing on sharing & learning, health & wellbeing, venue & performance & outreach activities. We promote equality through information, education, wellbeing and creative programmes that widen participation and create open access. UNLH is managed by the Upper Norwood Library Trust (UNLT - an independent charity), formed in 2012 by local residents.

Find out about access to and facilities for people with disabilities in the National Art Library and our other study rooms.

If you are a group involved in researching, studying, working or participating in the arts and would like to visit the Library, you can contact us at: nalvisits@vam.ac.uk. Group visits require a minimum of six weeks notice.

In addition to the National Art Library, we also have a number of other study rooms, both on- and off-site, where it is possible to view over 2 million objects from the reference collections and to conduct private research.

To request items to view in the Library and our other study rooms, you will first need to join the Library by creating a user account. This can be done in advance or during your visit.

Create an account by completing our online form. Once you have set a password, you will be able to login to the library catalogue and place requests.

On your first visit to the Library you will need to show current ID (e.g. passport, bank card, national ID card, etc.) and proof of address (e.g. bank statement, utility bill, driving licence, etc.), in order to complete the joining process and be issued with a Library card.

Renewing your Library card If your membership has expired and you wish to request items in advance of your visit, please contact us: nal.enquiries@vam.ac.uk, online and we will extend your expiry date. On your visit to the Library we will then issue you with your new Library card on receipt of your ID.

Find and request print collections available to view in our study rooms, as well as to discover our e-resources, which include databases, dictionaries, encyclopaedias, e-books and e-journals. Some e-resources are only available to view when you are in our study rooms due to licensing arrangements.

You can find information on how to search the library catalogue and request material in our downloadable instructions.

All items may only be consulted in the Library and cannot be borrowed.

We recommend that you request items in advance of your visit to make the most of your time in the Library. You can request up to 8 items at a time. Please note that some rare items can only be requested during your visit or are available by appointment – this is indicated in the library catalogue. 

Our staff can help you with questions about our library collections and services, as well as specific queries related to art and design. Please contact us with your enquiries: nal.enquiries@vam.ac.uk

Our subject guides on a range of topics, including auction house sale catalogues, artists and the history of the V&A can be found alongside other reading lists in the 'course reserves' feature of the library catalogue.

Copying is subject to UK copyright law and permitted for private study or non-commercial research. The amount you copy must be 'fair and justifiable' and no more than a single chapter or 10% of a total work.

Onsite copying

You may take photographs using hand-held devices or at the camera stands provided. Please note that flash or use of other artificial light is not permitted in order to protect our collections and avoid disrupting other readers. Please treat all material with great care and make use of the book supports and weights. Ask a member of staff if you need help or advice in handling any item.

Book scanners are available and free to use with a USB drive. Bring your own or purchase a USB drive at the Library counter.

The Library holds around one million books on subjects central to the V&A collections including prints, drawings, paintings, photographs, ceramics and glass, textiles and fashion, furniture, design, metalwork and sculpture. Our rich collections range from medieval manuscripts to contemporary artists' books and armorial bindings to comics and graphic novels.
